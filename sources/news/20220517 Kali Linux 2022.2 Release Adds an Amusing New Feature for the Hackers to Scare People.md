Kali Linux is not your usual Linux distribution. It is specially tailored for penetration testing and ethical hackers to learn/experiment.

We get interesting tools and feature additions with a new Kali Linux release. Let us take a look at the highlights for Kali Linux 2022.2.

### Kali Linux 2022.2: What’s New?

Kali Linux 2022.2 is an intriguing release introducing updated desktop environments, upgrading the Linux Kernel, adding new tools, and more improvements.

Not just limited to the usual refinements, you also get to see a new screensaver with many surprising elements.

#### The New Screensaver with Hollywood Nostalgia

Kali Linux has been featured in numerous TV Shows/Movies (like Mr. Robot) where they focus on hacking, considering it looks cool.

To take it up a notch, Kali Linux has added a new screensaver (that you can separately install), with surprising elements from Hollywood and some hacking scenes to scare away people.

They tease Matrix’s Neo, and also add a beautiful Kali Linux logo in the screensaver.
