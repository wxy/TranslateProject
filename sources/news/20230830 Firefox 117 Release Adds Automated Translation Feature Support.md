Firefox 117 Release Adds Automated Translation Feature Support
======
Firefox 117 release brings along necessary improvements and a new
feature support for the upcoming upgrade.
Firefox is a browser loved by many, hated by few. But, as **an open-source alternative to Chromium-based browsers** such as Chrome and Opera, it constantly evolves to add new features to its arsenal.

And this time around, with the **Firefox 117** release, we have an interesting addition that was in the making for quite some time now.

Allow me to take you through that, and more in this article. Let's begin.

## 🆕 Firefox 117: What's New?

Like most Firefox releases, this too has a lot to offer. Some notable highlights include:

  * **New privacy-focused native translation feature** ( _a work in progress_ )
  * **Expansion of the credit card autofill feature to more locales.**
  * **YouTube video lists now scroll correctly with a screen reader.**



While the feature set sounds good, let us focus on the translation feature.

### Privacy-Focused Translations

As shown in the demo above, Firefox now features an in-built translation tool.

Its main selling point is that **all language translations happen locally** , without your data being sent to any server for processing.

This kind of functionality already existed in Firefox thanks to an add-on called '[Firefox Translations][3]'.

But, [back then][4], integrating this directly into Firefox was discarded owing to its third-party dependencies after Mozilla's internal security review of the engine codebase.

Luckily, now we have proper native functionality. **But, there's a catch.**

🚧

Thanks to [Ghack][5], I found that **the translation feature was disabled by default on Firefox 117. They plan to gradually roll it out to users, and by default on its next version update**.

So, to test it out, I had to manually enable it by going into ' **about:config** ', then enabling the 'b **rowser.translations.enable** ' flag among advanced preferences.

### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

Other than that, here are a few other changes that are worth noting:

  * Various security updates.
  * macOS users can now control the tabability of controls and links.
  * Web compatibility inspection has been enhanced for their new CSS compatibility tooltip. (useful for web developers)
  * A new preference to allow for the disabling of the context menu that appears when pressing shift+right-click.



You can go through the [release notes][7] to dive deeper into this release.
