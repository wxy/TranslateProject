Dubbed as **a secure tablet** , Librem 11 is powered by their in-house Linux distro [**PureOS**][3], alongside **[PureBoot][4]** for offering a very secure and privacy-focused experience.

The **security and privacy of the device is ensured by Purism** , thanks to a variety of measures that they have taken:

The first is the **secure boot process** that works thanks to PureBoot, which can be coupled together with the [**Librem Key**][5] to further enhance security, and cryptographically identify tampering when used with PureBoot.

The second is **Purism's commitment to not spying on their users** , by avoiding any surveillance, or data mining practices.

And, the final one is the add-on '[ **Anti-Interdiction**][6]' service for Librem 11 which ensures that the device has not been tampered with before, during, or after the manufacturing and shipping processes.

You may be wondering; All this talk about security and privacy, but, **what powers it?**

The Librem 11 is powered by an **[Intel N5100][8] CPU**, alongside **8 GB of LPDDR4 RAM** , and **a whopping 1 TB of NVMe storage**.

As for the display, the tablet features a multitouch **60hz 11.5″ AMOLED display** , with a resolution of **2560×1600.**

📋

The Intel Management Engine is disabled on the CPU by default, owing to security concerns.

It also comes pre-equipped with a **pen with 4096 pressure levels** and **tilt support** , alongside a **detachable keyboard** that also **acts as a protective sleeve** when the tablet is folded.

  * Fingerprint Reader.
