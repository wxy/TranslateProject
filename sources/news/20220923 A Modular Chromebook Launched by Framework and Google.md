![A Modular Chromebook Launched by Framework and Google][1]

[Framework][2] has launched a Chromebook in collaboration with Google; the main focus of their products has always been to provide repairable and modular laptops.

With the launch of this laptop, they have implemented the same formula as their previous laptops, but with a touch of Google in the form of ChromeOS.

Let's see what they have on offer.

### Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition

The laptop runs ChromeOS and is a user-serviceable laptop with a very high degree of modularity.

It is based on the existing '[Framework Laptop][4],' with a milled aluminum chassis, that can comfortably house all the parts and keeps the weight in check at 1.3 kg.

Users can choose from a host of different options, such as switching out memory and storage or the ability to choose which ports they want and where they want those.

You can choose from a variety of RAM options ranging from 8 GB to 64 GB, in terms of storage, users can install up to a 1 TB NVMe SSD and an additional SSD of either 250 GB or 1 TB capacity. The default configuration comes with 256 GB of storage.

Being a modular laptop, you can choose your ports, like USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, or Ethernet, and have them on any side you want.

By providing these user-friendly modularities and using post-consumer recycled materials, Framework offers a very sustainable product compared to its competitors.

Regarding privacy, the Chromebook has two hardware privacy switches that cut power from the camera and the microphones to disable any access.

#### Specifications

The Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition is powered by a **12-core Intel i5-1240P**, which can turbo up to 4.4 GHz; it also features Intel's Iris Xe graphics for running graphical workloads.

Other notable highlights include:

* 13.5-inch display (2256x1504) with 100% sRGB support and a 3:2 aspect ratio.
* 55Wh battery.
* Set of 80dB Stereo 2W Speakers.
* Backlight keyboard with 1.5 mm key travel.
* Support for WiFi 6E.
* 1080p 60FPS webcam.

#### Availability & Pricing

The laptop is up for pre-order starting at **$999** on their [official website][9]; it is currently limited to buyers from the US and Canada only.

They are expecting shipments to begin in early December and are offering a fully-refundable **$100 deposit to pre-book** the laptop.

Framework seems to have taken the right step in attracting users to its product by offering a specific ChromeOS version of its existing laptop, especially after Google has seemingly stopped any further development on their ChromeOS laptops, the Pixelbook series.

üí¨ *What do you think? Can this be a viable alternative compared to the other Chromebooks in the market?*
