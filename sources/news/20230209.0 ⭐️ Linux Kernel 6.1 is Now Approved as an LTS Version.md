Linux Kernel 6.1 is Now Approved as an LTS Version
======

Linux Kernel 6.1 was due for approval for more than a month as the last LTS version of 2022. Now, that's a green light!

![Linux Kernel 6.1 is Now Approved as an LTS Version][1]

Linux Kernel 6.1 was the last kernel release of 2022; usually, these end up as an LTS release.

But this time around, the decision to make it LTS was delayed.

Some key feedback was pending from the kernel stakeholders around test results before they planned on using this kernel for the long term.

Fortunately, those things have since been resolved, and now **Linux Kernel 6.1 is an LTS release.**

Let me take you through the gist of this move.

### Linux 6.1 is Now Officially an LTS Release

Since its debut in December, **Greg Kroah-Hartman**, the Linux stable maintainer, was planning on Linux 6.1 as an LTS release, but the pending feedback delayed the move.

Now, he and co-maintainer Sasha Levin have finally received enough responses that maintaining Linux Kernel 6.1 as an LTS makes sense.

As things stand right now, the projected end-of-life for 6.1 is **December 2026,** with the potential for an extension if enough users or companies are interested in using it.

Initially, this was planned for a 2-year LTS cycle but was later updated to the **current 4-year maintenance period**.

You will also notice that many Linux Kernels are being maintained concurrently as LTS versions.

### Linux Kernel 6.1: Overview

If you missed out on the release, Here are some of the highlights that arrived with Linux Kernel 6.1:

- **Experimental Support for Rust**
- **Optimizations for AMD PCs**
- **Initial Support for Intel Meteor Lake**
- **Improved ARM SoC Support**

These are not the only things on offer; you may go through our article for a better outlook.
