Razer and Lambda Team Up to Unveil a Linux Laptop for Deep Learning
======

Razer is known for its gaming peripherals and hardware.

On the other hand, Lambda offers workstations, servers, and GPU clusters equipped with their software stack to facilitate deep learning as conveniently as possible.

They have collaborated to present a sleek-looking modern laptop (powered by Ubuntu 20.04) tailored for deep learning on the go.

And, it isn’t like any [other Linux laptops][1] available.

In case you are curious, deep learning is a type of machine learning where you teach a computer to process information similar to how humans do (by example). You can explore [Wikipedia][2] for more details.

### Tensorbook: The Deep Learning Laptop

The Tensorbook is a Linux-powered laptop with state-of-the-art specifications to help you efficiently work with deep learning training/development anywhere. And, Lambda’s software stack supports all the tools to conveniently update PyTorch, Tensorflow, CUDA, etc., with just a single command.

Of course, the name isn’t a surprise, considering tensor cores help speed up the machine learning training/process.

Razer did not add any of their usual signature patterns with this laptop, like a green accent/color, logo, or RGB elements. Well, for the greater good, this is tailored for deep learning. So, it is only fair that it isn’t too flashy.

You only find the lambda logo as the primary on the lid and a Razer x Lambda text on the bottom bezel of the screen. And, the purple accent goes all over, Lambda taking the lead on its branding here.

The specifications for the laptop involve:

  * **GPU**: GeForce RTX 3080 Max-Q 16 GB VRAM
  * **CPU:** Intel i7-11800H
  * **RAM:** 64 GB 3200 MHz DDR4
  * **Storage:** 2 TB NVMe PCIe 4.0
  * **Display:** 165 Hz 1440p 15.6-inch



In addition to the solid core configuration, the connectivity options include:

  * 3 x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports
  * 1 x HDMI 2.1
  * 1 x UHS-III SD Card Reader
  * 3.5 mm Headphone/Microphone jack
  * 2 x Thunderbolt 4 ports
  * Wi-Fi 6E
  * Bluetooth 5.2



Undoubtedly, the laptop is a sleek powerhouse with all the components packed in it.

The RTX 3080 GPU should be capable enough to help with your deep learning tasks, whether you are a professional or a beginner.

Of course, it isn’t pitched for gaming, but with what you have, along with a high refresh rate screen, you can comfortably game on it when you want.

The machine learning training benchmarks claim that it is way ahead of the M1 Max chip.

So, you will not have any trouble with training models.

### Pricing and Availability

It is a premium offering, so the price tag suits the same, starting at **$3499**. You can customize it for enterprise settings to pack in Windows 10 and Ubuntu.

An extended warranty and premium support is available if you want to pay the extra.

You can customize and proceed with the purchase on Lambda’s official website.
