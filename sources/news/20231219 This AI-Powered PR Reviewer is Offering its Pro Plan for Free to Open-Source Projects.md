This AI-Powered PR Reviewer is Offering its Pro Plan for Free to Open-Source Projects
======
CodeRabbit wants to give back to the open-source community with its free
offering. Some open-source projects may get the boost with such
services, not bad at all!
CodeRabbit is **an interesting AI-powered code reviewing tool** that offers quick “ _context aware_ ” reviews of code, resulting in reduced time being spent on manually reviewing the code.

They offer an open-source version of their product (with limited features), and a SaaS offering. You can unlock the **advanced features** with their paid “ _Pro_ ” plan.

Considering they are not an entirely open-source solution, why are we here?

Well, some good news for the open-source community if they like to use such a tool: **CodeRabbit has made its Pro plan free for open-source projects.**

Let's take a look at it.

### CodeRabbit Pro: Supporting Open-Source Projects

![][1]

Powered by OpenAI's **GPT 4** and **GPT 3.5** large language models (LLMs), CodeRabbit is a very well-known code reviewing tool **being used in over 50,000 repositories** across GitHub and GitLab.

Even though they have an open-source project in the form of [AI PR Reviewer][2], CodeRabbit is strictly their [SaaS][3] brainchild, which is **not open-source**.

According to CodeRabbit, **they wanted to show their appreciation towards open source authors** , and to also further strengthen their stand on taking open-source software development further. Hence, **they want to give back to the community in form of a free access to the premium tool for open-source developers.**

As for **what benefits open-source projects will receive;**

For starters, the **CodeRabbit Pro plan** , which costs **$15 a month per developer** , is provided free of charge, then there's the promise of **community support** should you run into any issues.

Thanks to all of that, you can take advantage of the **advanced features of CodeRabbit**.

Here are some of them:

  * Access to the **CodeRabbit chatbot**.
  * **No limit** on the number of public and private repositories.
  * **Line-by-line review** of the code, with relevant suggestions being served.
  * Ability to **automatically link related issues with the pull requests** on the repo.
  * A **Codebase Verification** feature that sees CodeRabbit analyze the overall codebase.
  * Get more insights about PRs.



However, do keep in mind that **the rate limits for the “ _free for open source_ ” Pro plan are lower than the paid plan.** If a project hits the limit in any place, access will be restored after the timeout period.

Here are CodeRabbit's usual usage limits for reference. 👇

So, if you think your open-source projects could benefit through such a tool, you can sign up for it.

#### How Do You Sign Up?

Well, first you have to ensure that you are eligible, meaning, **you should have a public repository**.

Then head over to the [CodeRabbit website][5] and log in with GitHub or GitLab. Thereafter, add the CodeRabbit app to your account or organization, then authorize it with GitHub/GitLab.

After doing all that, the code review should start automatically with new pull requests or incremental commits. For further usage instructions, you can also refer to the [official documentation][6].
