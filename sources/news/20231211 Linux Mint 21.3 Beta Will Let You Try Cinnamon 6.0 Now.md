Linux Mint 21.3 Beta Will Let You Try Cinnamon 6.0 Now!
======
Linux Mint 21.3 beta is here!
Linux Mint is arguably one of the [best Ubuntu-based Linux distros][1] out there. Many in the Linux community prefer it over Ubuntu due to its community-focused approach to handling things.

In just a few weeks time, we will be seeing the release of **Linux Mint 21.3**. However, before that, we now have a sneak peek into what that Long-term support release will offer.

Let's dive in!

🚧

Proceed with caution, this beta release is only meant for testing. The stable release will be out soon.

### Linux Mint 21.3 Beta: What's on Offer? 🤔

![][2]

Powered by [Linux kernel 5.15][3], and [Ubuntu 22.04][4], this beta release of Linux Mint 21.3 has plenty to offer. Some **key highlights** include:

  * **Inclusion of Cinnamon 6.0**
  * **Application Upgrades**
  * **New Wallpapers**



#### Inclusion of Cinnamon 6.0

![][5]

Linux Mint 21.3 Beta features the recently introduced [Cinnamon 6.0 release][6] that features **experimental support for Wayland** , **various improvements for X11** , **support for AVIF images** and more.

What took me by surprise was **a new add-on** (Cinnamon calls the add-ons as “ _spices_ ”), called “ **Actions** ”. It was formerly known as “ _Nemo Actions_ ”, and its functioning was limited to the file manager.

But, as demonstrated by the image above, **this new spice lets you install add-ons for enhancing the overall Cinnamon desktop experience** , while not being limited to just making tweaks to the file manager.

Moreover, **all the screenshots in this article** were taken in the Wayland session, and with what I saw, the **Wayland session seems to perform decently**. Though, I would still give it some time to mature, as the developers are still working on it.

#### Application Upgrades

On the application side of things, **Warpinator now lets you manually connect to other devices** by either entering IP addresses, or on mobile, by scanning a QR code.

The **backup tool also sees an update** , with it now featuring a header bar with a dedicated “ _About_ ” dialog.

Even **Hypnotix** , the TV viewing application, has been **updated with new features**.

You can now **set channels as favorites** , and they will be grouped together, irrespective of the TV provider. You can also **create new channels** by entering streamable URLs to turn them into custom TV channels.

#### New Wallpapers

To wrap things up, the **Linux Mint 21.3 beta features some nice-looking wallpapers** that were the work of various contributing artists.
