Kubuntu 22.10 is Now Available!
======

Kubuntu 22.10 may not be the most exciting upgrade. But, it includes useful changes!

![Kubuntu 22.10 is Now Available!][1]

Kubuntu is an official Ubuntu flavor that offers a lot of functionality in a refined KDE-powered package.

The release of Kubuntu 22.10 promises various improvements and a newer version of [KDE Plasma][2].

Let us go through the highlights of this release.

### Kubuntu 22.10: What's New?

Kubuntu 22.10 is bringing in a lot of updates, some of the important ones that you can expect are:

- **KDE Plasma 5.25**
- **Linux Kernel 5.19**
- **PipeWire**
- **Firefox 104**
- **Qt 5.15.6**

> 💡Kubuntu 22.10 will be supported for nine months until **July 2023**. If you want stability over features, you should prefer using an [LTS version][4].

#### KDE Plasma 5.25

Even though[KDE Plasma 5.26][6] was released recently, Kubuntu 22.10 ships with KDE Plasma 5.25.

However, KDE Plasma 5.25 is still a major update over 5.24, which contained a lot of improvements such as, enhanced support for touchpads/touchscreens, upgrades to the user interface, and more.

You can read our coverage of KDE Plasma 5.25 to learn more:

Also, you can expect KDE Plasma 5.26 to come as a point release instead of being part of the launch of Kubuntu 22.10.

#### PipeWire Default

Like most Ubuntu 22.10-based distros, [PipeWire][7] is the default audio/video handler in this version of Kubuntu.

It replaces [PulseAudio][8], known to not play nice with Ubuntu 22.10.

#### Linux Kernel 5.19

#### Wayland Session for Testing
