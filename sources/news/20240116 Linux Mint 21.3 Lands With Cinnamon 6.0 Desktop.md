Linux Mint 21.3 Lands With Cinnamon 6.0 Desktop
======
Linux Mint 21.3 has arrived!
Being one of the [best Linux distros for Ubuntu lovers][1], Linux Mint is a very popular alternative to Ubuntu that differentiates itself by providing a beautiful user interface with Flatpak support by default (instead of Snap).

The last major release was [Linux Mint 21.2][2] that provided many improvements, especially in the visuals department. But, with a recent announcement, the **Linux Mint 21.3 “Virginia” release** aims to one up that by serving more refinements over its predecessor.

So, let's take a brief look at it.

## 🆕 Linux Mint 21.3: What's New?

![][4]

Introduced as **a long-term support release** (until 2027), Linux Mint 21.3 uses [Ubuntu 22.04][5] and [Linux kernel 5.15][6] as its base to deliver a range of improvements.

We start with the **updated application suite** that now sees **Hypnotix** , the TV viewer application, being offered with new features such as the **ability to set channels as favorites** , **add custom channels** , and **much tighter** [**Yt-dlp**][7] **integration**.

Similarly, with **Warpinator** , you can now manually connect to other devices by entering IP addresses, or by scanning a QR code. The [Sticky][8] note-taking app also sees an update, it now has **support for DBUS commands that make it possible to implement scripts or keybindings** for managing notes.

Then there's the **highlight of this release** , [Cinnamon 6.0][9], which features a new add-on category called “ **spices** ” (formerly known as “ _Nemo Actions_ ”) that **allows you to install neat add-ons** to further augment the user experience on Cinnamon.

Linux Mint 21.3 is also the release where we see **experimental support for Wayland** , the developers don't expect it to replace the Xorg session anytime soon, but are slowly working towards it. They **don't expect it to be ready before 2026** , that would put it around the time Linux Mint 23.x is scheduled to go live.

And to wrap this up, the **Linux Mint 21.3 release also features some new, very neat looking wallpapers** that were the work of community contributors.

You can go through our [previous coverage][11] of the beta or the [announcement blog][12] for more details on this release.

### ⚙️ Upgrade from Older Release

First and foremost, ensure that you have backed up all your data using a system snapshot tool like [Timeshift][15]. Then, fire up the “ _Update Manager_ ” and click on the “ _Refresh_ ” button to check for new version of “ _mintupdate_ ” or “ _mint-upgrade-info_ ”, then apply updates, if there are any.

![][16]

Now, go into the “ _Edit_ ” menu and click on _Upgrade to “Linux Mint 21.3 Virginia”_ to get started with the system upgrade.

Follow the on-screen instructions and replace the configuration files when asked to do so. When the upgrade process is finished, do a reboot to finish applying the changes.

If you have any doubts, then you can refer to the official [upgrade blog][17].
