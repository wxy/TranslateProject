Microsoft Teams Progressive Web App Experience is Here for Linux
======

Microsoft Teams PWA is now available for Linux users!

![Microsoft Teams Progressive Web App Experience is Here for Linux][1]

After recently [dropping support][2] for a native Microsoft Teams Linux app, Microsoft has finally made the **PWA** (progressive web app) available to everyone.

PWA is an app that uses the same code as a website but with a few changes that make it easier to use it as an app.

Users of the native Linux app have mixed feelings about this move, some welcoming it and others not.

Let us take a look at what Microsoft has done with this app.

### ⭐ Microsoft Teams Progressive Web App

With the [Microsoft Teams][4] PWA, you get several features already available on the Windows client. So, it is a good thing for most users.

The features include:

- **Ability to set custom backgrounds**
- **A new gallery view**
- **Reactions to chats**
- **Raise-a-hand feature during meetings**
- **System Notifications**

The Teams PWA comes with a dock icon and can be set to auto-start on system boot.

Additionally, it gets easy access to app permissions and can be used with Conditional Access configuration (for Azure users), applied via the Endpoint Manager.

### 👇 How to Use the PWA

![microsoft teams pwa install prompt][5]

When you first log in to Teams on a web browser, it should show you a pop-up similar to the one shown above.

Click on it to install the PWA, launch it from your application list, and then use it like a desktop app.

> 💡Users of Firefox beware: Only Chromium-based browsers like Chrome and Edge support PWAs.

But, if it doesn't show you a pop-up, or you mistakenly clicked on 'Not-now', follow these steps to install the Teams PWA.

For **Microsoft Edge**:

1. Log in to Teams through the [official website][7]. 2. Click on the three-dot menu of the browser. 3. Then go into '**Apps**.' as shown in the screenshot above. 4. Click on '**Install this site as an app.**'  5. Set the app name and click on '**Install**' to set up the Teams PWA.

If you are using Google Chrome on Linux, here's what it looks like:
