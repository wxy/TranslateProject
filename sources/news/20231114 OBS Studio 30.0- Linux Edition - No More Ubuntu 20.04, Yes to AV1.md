OBS Studio 30.0: Linux Edition - No More Ubuntu 20.04, Yes to AV1
======
OBS Studio 30.0 is a significant release for Linux users.
OBS Studio is arguably one of the [best screen recorders for Linux][1], it is a popular choice for many content creators out there who use it for their video recording and streaming needs.

A recent announcement has seen the introduction of **a new major release** in the form of **OBS Studio 30** , this has arrived almost 11 months after its [last major release][2] back in January.

Allow me to take you through this.

## 🆕 OBS Studio 30: What's New?

![][4]

Being a major release, OBS Studio 30 features plenty of improvements to look forward to, but, also has **a change that might not sit well with some users**.

Some **key highlights** of this release include:

  * **Support Dropped for Ubuntu 20.04**
  * **Improved UI/UX**
  * **Better Video Coding**



### Support Dropped for Ubuntu 20.04

With the release of OBS Studio 30, Ubuntu 20.04 is no longer supported.

The main reason behind that decision was that **it was becoming more difficult for the developers to maintain Qt 5** , which in turn affected their work on bringing improvements to the UI/UX side of OBS.

And as it turns out, **Ubuntu 20.04 was the only first-party distribution using Qt 5 for OBS** , which, according to the developer, already had **a dwindling user base** in comparison to the other variants.

This is **not a change that happened overnight** , it was already announced back in June on OBS Studio's GitHub repo.

**Users of Ubuntu 20.04** now have two options, either they can [upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04][5] or later, or they can switch to using the [Flatpak version][6] of OBS Studio.

The devs have **also revealed that they might plan to drop support for Qt 6.2 and Ubuntu 22.04 around April 2025.** Of course, you have nothing to worry about it for now. You can read [official announcement][7] for details regarding the plans.

### Improved UI/UX

![][8]

A new option was added to the “Docks” menu that enables **Full-Height docks**. This will come in handy for integrating those long chat windows found on Twitch and YouTube while live-streaming.

Even the **status bar was redesigned** for providing the same information, but, in a more organized/structured manner. I like what they have done to it.

The **older status bar was a bit finicky** to refer to, and I would often forget that it even existed while streaming or recording 😆

![][9]

A new “ **Safe Mode** ” was also added with OBS Studio 30, this will start up the application without loading any third-party plugins, scripting or web sockets **for troubleshooting purposes**.

There are two ways to access it, one is when OBS Studio shuts down unexpectedly, and the other is manually via the “Help” menu as shown below.

### Better Video Coding

Support for **three major video coding tech** was added with OBS Studio 30. They are [**Intel QSV**][11] **H264** , **High Efficiency Video Coding ([ **HEVC**][12])**, and [**AV1**][13].

These additions to OBS will be appreciated by many content creators using Linux.

### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

Other than the above-mentioned, here are some other changes worth noting:

  * Introduction of **WHIP/WebRTC output**.
  * Ability to **arrange filters** by dragging and dropping.
  * Support for **YouTube Live control room panel**.
  * Fix for **an issue with logging** high frame rate video capture devices.
  * Added support for **10-bit capture and HDR playback** for [Decklink][14].
