Linux-First AI Image Upscaler Upscayl Released its First Version
======
Not every day you come across an application with 'Linux-first' approach.

![Linux-First AI Image Upscaler Upscayl Released its First Version][1]

Got a pixelated, low-resolution image from the 2000s? Thanks to the advancement of artificial intelligence, you can easily enhance pixelated images into better resolution images.

Using a regular image editor requires manual efforts for upscaling the images.

There are tons of online AI image upscalers available, but they can't be trusted with your data.

A new project tries to solve this by providing you with a simple desktop application that lets you enhance low resolution photos in a new click.

It's first version is released today.

### Upscayl Features

[Upscayl][2] is a cross-platform application built with the Linux-first philosophy.

This simply means that Linux builds get priority but other platforms will also be supported.

Developed using Python and JavaScript, Upscayl gives a simple interface where you select the input image and output folder and hit the Upscayl button to enhance the image.

Here's a video of Upscayl in action.

### Using Upscayl

I don't have lots of blurry pictures on my computer. Not that I am an excellent photographer, just too lazy to look for them among thousands of pictures.

Still, I managed to get a blurry, old photo from 2011 (it was 11 years ago and can be considered old now).

Don't judge me because I took a random photo of my kitchen counter. There must have been a good reason (or so I want to believe).

Anyway. I tried to upscale the image with Upscayl.

![Using Upscayl][5]

It took quite some processing power, but my 8-core, 11th Gen i7 processor with 16 GB RAM easily handled it.

The single image processing took around 4 minutes and the 435 KB image resulted in a 24 MB image. Quite honestly, I hardly noticed visible differences.

I wanted to embed the final result in the article here. But uploading a 24 MB image would be overkill for my server and your browser.

### Getting Upscayl

Still, my not-so-successful experiment should not deter you from trying it out yourself.

The application is available for Linux at the moment. Support for Windows and macOS is planned.

You can get Upscayl in AppImage and Flatpak formats. I used the AppImage version, you can use whichever you prefer.

The files are available on the release page.
