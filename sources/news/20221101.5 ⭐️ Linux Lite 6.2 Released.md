Linux Lite 6.2 Released
======

Linux Lite 6.2 is an ideal upgrade with the useful changes, nothing too fancy.

![Linux Lite 6.2 Released][1]

Linux Lite is a popular lightweight Windows-like distro that gives users a familiar operating system.

The latest release, Linux Lite 6.2, is based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and has brought forward a variety of changes to the UI along with various bug fixes.

### Linux Lite 6.2: What's New?

This release of Linux Lite focuses on user interface tweaks and bug fixes, with changes to a few applications.

Some key highlights include:

- **Updated Icons**
- **New Wallpapers**
- **Shotcut Video Editor**
- **Removal Of Microsoft Teams**
- **LibreOffice 7.3.6.2**
- **Linux Kernel 5.15**

#### Shotcut Replaces OpenShot

![linux lite 6.2 shotcut video editor][3]

Yes, [Shotcut][4] now replaces [OpenShot][5] as the default video editor on Linux Lite 6.2.

OpenShot gets the place because it didn't work well with Ubuntu 22.04, and without a utility like this, users would have to look for one on their own.

Shotcut is undoubtedly a good video editor. So, it should be a good option.

#### Microsoft Teams Removed

Another significant change is that Microsoft Teams is no longer included in the distro.

The reason for that is the discontinuation of the Linux application by Microsoft in favor of a progressive web app version.

Our previous coverage can give you more insight into that:

#### Updated Icons and New Wallpapers
