![Budgie's Upcoming 10.7 Release Promises These 3 Key Improvements for Linux Users][1]

Budgie is a desktop environment designed to keep clutter to a minimum and provide users with a clean/minimal experience.

Back in January 2022, the former-co-lead of Solus, **Joshua Strobl**[left Solus][2] to work on [SerpentOS][3], but he continued to work on Budgie.

So, he forked the project into a new repository and formed the [Buddies Of Budgie][4] organization. Three months after that, they released **Budgie 10.6**.

It was a good release, if not extraordinary.

Moving forward, they have shared the plans for 2023 which include the release of **Budgie 10.7**.

[Joshua Strobl][5] also mentioned more about the plans in the blog post:

> At the very least, it should serve as a good foundation to build on and provide a clear picture on where Budgie Desktop is going this year: Budgie 10.x will receive new features, QoL improvements, and fixes. Budgie 11 development will be underway.

### Budgie 10.7: What Can You Expect?

The development of Budgie 10.7 has been going on since last year. It was supposed to release in 2022, but more time was required to serve a polished experience.

A lot of work has been done, but some of the notable ones include the following three changes:

- **Updates to Budgie Menu**
- **New Budgie Screenshot Tool**
- **Improvements to Budgie Run Dialog**

#### Updates to Budgie Menu

For this release, Budgie Menu is set to receive several improvements, such as:

- A new power menu with all the usual options, such as **Suspend, Hibernate, Logout, and Power Off**.
- Updated personal user menu with quick XDG directory access. This will let you open a file manager window directly into folders like Home, Documents, Music, etc.
- Quick access to Budgie Control Center and Desktop Settings.
- Ability to show various desktop settings from the menu itself.

#### Budgie Screenshot Tool

Finally, you won't need to download another tool to take a screenshot on Budgie; from 10.7 onwards, it will feature a native screenshot application.

It will have capture support for the screen, window, and even selection capture!

#### Improvements to Budgie Run Dialog

The Budgie Run dialog will receive many improvements, such as:

- A new application indexer will be used for Budgie Menu to find and sort applications. It is supposed to provide a 'predictable fuzzy search experience'.
- Improved calculation of dialog sizing according to the work area of the monitor.
- Better styling of labels for application names and descriptions.

### Release & Future Plans

According to their [announcement][9], they intend to release Budgie 10.7 sometime in **Q1, 2023.** They haven't settled for a specific date yet.

A 10.7.1 release with bug fixes has been planned soon after, and the release of **Budgie 10.8** in Q2, 2023.
