System76 Hardware is Making its Way to Europe Soon
======

System76’s [recent partnership with HP][1] for a developer-focused laptop made users think that it should enable users across the globe to get their hands on a laptop with Pop!_OS pre-installed.

Unfortunately, the HP Dev One laptop is limited to U.S. customers as of now. But, it seems like you can expect System76 hardware to be available in Europe very soon.

### System76 to Make its Mechanical Keyboard Available First

As per an [interview][2] with System76’s principal engineer, Jeremy Soller, System76 has plans to come up with a distribution center for Europe in the coming months.

Unfortunately, they will not be making laptops/desktops available. The process of minimizing shipping charges, taxes, and other stuff with computers needs time.

Hence, they plan to start with the [Launch mechanical keyboard][3] and an upcoming Launch Lite edition by System76.

Not to forget, Europe will need a different keyboard layout as well. So, you could be in for something comfortable as per your requirements.

Note that the planned European distribution hub by System76 does not aim to make its collaborative projects available (like HP Dev On). It is most likely that they will be focusing on making their hardware available.

However, no clarity has been provided on that front. So, you can expect System76 to expand to other regions, or they could improve their collaboration with laptop manufacturers to let more users experience Pop!_OS.

### Wrapping Up

If you cannot wait to get your hands on a System76 product, and you happen to live in the U.S. or Canada, you may want to explore the summer sale going on at [System76’s official website][5].

Europe’s customers need to wait for a couple of months to get System76’s Launch keyboard easily.

Hopefully, the laptops/desktops get available in the near future.

_Would you be willing to grab System76’s mechanical keyboard when it’s available for European users?_ _Share your thoughts in the comments below._
