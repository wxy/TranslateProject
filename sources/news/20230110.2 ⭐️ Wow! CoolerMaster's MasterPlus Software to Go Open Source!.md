Wow! CoolerMaster's MasterPlus Software to Go Open Source!
======

MasterPlus to get a complete overhaul and an open-source version? Sounds good!

![Wow! CoolerMaster's MasterPlus Software to Go Open Source!][1]

Most gaming/peripheral software suits are either proprietary or not officially available for Linux.

As a result, we must constantly look for open-source tools to configure our hardware to get native functionality.

The likes of [Piper][2], [OpenRGB][3], [Solaar][4], etc. come in handy in these situations.

But, sometimes, even these are not enough.

Luckily, [CoolerMaster][5] has decided to release an open-source version of its [MasterPlus][6] software that aims to work with its coolers and non-CoolerMaster coolers.

**While this does not guarantee its availability for Linux systems, we can definitely hope for it.**

This move should also encourage other companies like Razer and Logitech to consider making open-source tools that do away with bloat found in them.

Let's see what CoolerMaster plans to do.

### MasterPlus Open-Source Version: What We Know So Far

![coolermaster masterplus revamp][7]

**CoolerMaster revealed their plans to release a new MasterPlus open-source version** in the recent [CES 2023][8] event. Kudos to **Albert** from [Boring Text Reviews][9] for bringing this to our attention.

**What to expect?:** A complete redesign of the MasterPlus software, with an API plug-in system that allows non-CoolerMaster coolers to integrate with it.

They have clarified that exclusive CoolerMaster features won't work with other coolers. So, things such as detecting a leak in an AIO cooler or calculating the PSU's efficiency can't be tracked for third-party products.

Instead, the application will only support reading basic performance info such as temperature and fan speed with the ability to configure ARGB devices.

If you ask me, **this is better than nothing.** And, if you happen to use CoolerMaster components for your system, it is an exciting news for you!

CoolerMaster also showcased a potential application of the API system by letting it hook into a photo application and using it to control a secondary display integrated into a computer case's side.

Furthermore, they also introduced full cloud integration for their software. But sadly, this will not be made open-source.

**When to expect?:**

We do not have a concrete release date for the open sourcing of MasterPlus.

But, if I were to guess, sometime in 2023 would be the best bet.

💬 _Even if the tool is not confirmed to work for Linux users, on open-source tool is a good start, isn't it? What do you think?_
