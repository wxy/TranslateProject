Rhino Linux 2023.4 Update Adds An Auto-Tiling Feature
======
Rhino Linux gets a nifty feature with the last update for 2023.
[Rhino Linux][1] is an Ubuntu-based rolling distribution that aims to offer a stable experience with the advantages of a [rolling-release][2] approach. It rose from the ashes of the now defunct Rolling Rhino Remix project and has been receiving regular updates.

Ending 2023 on a high note, the developers have released **Rhino Linux 2023.4** with some insight into what the future holds for Rhino Linux.

So, join me as I take you through it.

## 🆕 Rhino Linux 2023.4: What's New?

![][4]

Powered by the recent [Linux Kernel 6.6 release][5], Rhino Linux 2023.4 comes equipped with an updated Unicorn Desktop that now **features optional auto-tiling functionality** that can be enabled from an applet in the top panel.

This was made possible thanks to the implementation of [cortile][6] that enables users to tile their windows effortlessly. It has support for things like **workspace-based tiling** , **hot corners** , **drag/drop window swapping,** and more.

Similarly, **uLauncher also sees an update** , with it now looking more rounded, and sporting a slightly different background color.

There have been **improvements on the ' _rhino-pkg_ ' side of things** too, now, ' _rhino-pkg update'_ no longer auto-removes packages by default if [Nala][7] is installed.

For cleaning up obsolete packages or broken dependencies, you can now run the new ' _rhino-pkg cleanup'_ command.

**Support for Pine64 devices has also been improved** , there is **a new user-friendly experimental Wi-Fi module** for PineTab2, **various modem stability fixes** for the PinePhone and PinePhone Pro coupled with the enabling of GPS support.

You can now also use flashlights on all PinePhones and PineTabs too! (if you are trying that)

### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

Other than the highlights, here are some other changes that you should know about:

  * A **complete** **transition to PipeWire** from PulseAudio.
  * **Connecting to Wi-Fi** on embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi has been improved.
  * [pacstall-qa][8] has been brought in as **a new default package** for testing pacscripts from PRs locally.



The developers have also shared **their plans for 2024** ; **** which include **support for offline installations** , **a new icon pack,** **contributing to the development of** [**UBXI ports**][9], **rewriting ' _rhino-pkg_ '** in [nushell][10], and more.

You may go through the [release notes][11] to learn more about this release, and future development plans.
