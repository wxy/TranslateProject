Archcraft: A Customized Lightweight Linux Distro Experience
======
Archcraft is an impressive distro with a customized out-of-the-box
experience.
We bid goodbye to 2023, a year filled with exciting distro and app releases. Even **AI took the world by storm** , with big tech scampering to get a piece of the coveted pie.

Nevertheless, we must now look ahead. 😃

We kick this year off with an interesting Arch-based Linux distribution called “ **Archcraft** ” that claims to be “ _just another Linux distribution_ ” but **can run with only 500 MB of RAM**.

So, let's dive in and see what it has to offer.

### Archcraft: Overview ⭐

![][1]

Being a [lightweight Linux distribution][2], Archcraft has been **built using Arch Linux as its base** to provide users with a **straight-to-the-point distro experience** that doesn't need much configuring.

Most things are pre-configured, the user just has to install it and get on with whatever they want to do with their system. This has been made possible thanks to the following **key features** of Archcraft:

  * **A Rolling-Release Cycle**
  * **In-Built Support for AUR**
  * **Pre-Installed Window Managers**

#### Initial Impressions 👨‍💻

To get started with Archcraft, I loaded it up on a [Virtual Machine][5] by [using VirtualBox][6], which was able to detect that it was an Arch Linux (64-bit) operating system right away.

After it booted, **a welcome app** showed up with options to access the user guide or run the installation, by using one of the **two installer options with Archcraft**.

![][7]

One was the conventional [Calamares][8] installer that we all know and love, the other was [ABIF][9] (Arch Base Installation Framework), which is **a command line-based installer** that is recommended for more advanced users.

I went about installing it using Calamares, and at some point I was **shown a menu to pick the window manager**. I went with “ _Both_ ”, which would then install [Openbox][10] and [bspwm][11].

📋

I went with Calamares because a cat ran over my keyboard and made me choose it. 😼

![][12]

The **installation went smoothly** , and I was able to boot into Archcraft without any issues. I then began to explore it.

As you can see below, **the desktop screen is extremely minimal** with a status bar at the top, and **a handy dock** at the bottom to launch apps with.

![][13]

The **status bar** has some really neat options too; from left to right, you will find the **application launcher** with the Archcraft logo, **a workspace switcher** , some **system usage info** , **the time/date** , **music player controls** , **volume slider** , **network usage info** , and **power buttons**.

![Status Bar on Archcraft][14]

When I clicked on the system usage info, I was shown [Alacritty][15], one of the [top terminal emulators for Linux][16], which showed me all the active processes, and what kind of resources they were using up.

I then moved over to check out the **pre-installed wallpapers** on Archcraft, and, to my surprise, [Rick][18] giving me the good ol' finger.

I must say, I had a nice giggle over this. I now know what Morty feels like. 😂

![][19]

I then checked out **the app launcher** , which was loaded quite well with useful apps. It was impressive to see this in such a minimal distro.

![][20]

I could also **search for commands** and even **browse files** in different directories.

![][21]

The **settings app was easy to use** and had all the important options in one place. What more could you want?

![][22]

So, to conclude this first look, I would say that Archcraft is a very [user-friendly Arch-based distribution][23] that is straightforward to get into. This should age like fine wine as development progresses.

Should you choose to, you could also contribute to the development of Archcraft by visiting its [GitHub repo][24].
