Bodhi 7.0 Releases Based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS With Desktop Enhancements
======
Bodhi Linux 7.0 is finally out! Essential upgrades and enhancements in
place.
Bodhi Linux is a popular [lightweight distro][1] that features the [Moksha][2] desktop environment, which provides a unique user experience.

The last major release was [Bodhi Linux 6.0][3], which came more than two years back with impressive improvements.

Bodhi Linux 7.0 has been on the roadmap for a while, but the development was stalled because the creator had some health issues. Hoping that the developer is doing better now; Let us look at the next upgrade.

### 🆕 Bodhi Linux 7.0: What's New?

This release of Bodhi Linux is based on [Ubuntu 22.04][5] LTS, which is a **pretty solid foundation**. Resulting in some good hardware support alongside performance and security enhancements.

Bodhi Linux 7.0 now features a **new default theme** called ' **MokshaGreen** ', which features an **animated background** , a **new boot Plymouth boot screen** , and a **new login screen theme**.

So, some visual bling to watch out for, even if it may not be much.
