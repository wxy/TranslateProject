TUXEDO Computers are one of the few manufacturers that provide fine-tuned Linux experiences out of the box.

You can expect Ubuntu/TUXEDO OS as your default options with any of their devices, but they also support more Linux distributions.

Now, they have come up with a refreshed product lineup, i.e., **InfinityBook Pro 14 (Gen 7).**And, it happens to be one of their flagship offerings!

### InfinityBook Pro 14: Key Highlights

InifnityBook Pro 14 sports a 3K resolution display (a.k.a. *Omnia 3K display*) with a 16:10 ratio.

To elevate your visual experience, the display supports 400 nits of brightness and complete sRGB color space coverage, so colors will be more natural.

It also has a matt coating to the panel that should eliminate the disturbing glares that may end up disturbing your productivity.

Tuxedo came up with two lightweight variants for this lineup, so you can choose what your workflow demands the most without compromising portability.

🔋 **An endurance edition with 99 Wh Battery**(*1.1 kg*)   💾  **A storage giant with 4 TB SSD (***1.3 kg***)**

99 Wh battery for a laptop sounds like a dream come true for users who want to get more out of their portable machines.

TUXEDO Computers claims around 10 hours of runtime while connected with active WLAN and web surfing and while used with battery saving mode/idle usage, this can go up to 16 hours!

If you do not need maximum endurance, you can opt for the second variant with more storage expansion opportunity.

You can use **x2 available M.2 slots**, by which you can upgrade your storage up to 4 TB (considering 2TB on each slot).

To maximize storage performance/reliability, you can connect the SSDs in a RAID cluster form.
