Kali Linux 2023.2 Release Adds a New Hyper-V Image and PipeWire to XFCE Variant
======

Kali Linux 2023.2 is a good upgrade with new feature additions and enhancements.

![kali linux 2023.2 release][1]

The [penetration testing-focused][2] Kali Linux distro has been around for some time now. Its robust set of tools has made it the de facto choice for many pen testers worldwide.

Earlier[this year][3], they **celebrated their 10th Anniversary** by launching a new '**Kali Purple**' distro. Now they have a new Kali Linux release that promises to offer some exciting improvements.

Let's go through it.

### 🆕 Kali Linux 2023.2: What's New?

![a screenshot of the neofetch output on kali linux 2023.2][4]

Kali Linux 2023.2 is a packed release, with [Linux Kernel 6.1][5] powering it. Some notable highlights of this release include:

- **PipeWire Support**
- **Desktop Upgrades**
- **Updated App Icons and Menu**

#### PipeWire Support

Kali Linux's default desktop, **XFCE, now uses** [**PipeWire**][7] for handling all the audio and video tasks across the system.

But, as you can see, its **implementation is slightly different than usual**. They had to use the compatibility layer '[**pipewire-pulse**][8]' to make it happen on XFCE, as it does not support it by default.

As an end-user, you won't notice anything different except the improvements offered by PipeWire over PulseAudio.

#### Desktop Upgrades

Kali Linux 2023.2 features some extensive upgrades for the various desktop experiences.

**In the case of XFCE**, apart from the PipeWire integration, a pre-installed extension is offered for the file manager called '[GtkHash][9]'.

This is meant to provide a simple way to **quickly compute checksums**, one has to simply right-click on a file and open the 'Checksums' tab, doing away with the need to open a terminal.

**In the case of GNOME**, this release of Kali Linux now features [GNOME 44][11], which will give you access to various new features such as an **improved quick settings menu**, **better file manager**, **file thumbnails,** and more.

That's not all; the devs have also introduced a new extension called '[Tiling Assistant][13]' for the GNOME version of Kali.

This extension now puts the GNOME version of Kali on par with the tiling experience found on the likes of KDE and XFCE.

The **Kali i3 desktop received a complete rework** with many improvements across the board; a long-time user of i3 and Kali contributor, Arszilla worked on it.

Though, keep in mind that if you want to try this out, the easiest way would be to build a custom installer ISO that has an i3 desktop.

You can refer to its [GitHub repo][15] for more info.

#### Updated App Icons and Menu

- **A new Hyper-V image for better performance on virtual machines.**
- **Python PIP behavior changes.**
- **Various updates to Kali ARM.**
