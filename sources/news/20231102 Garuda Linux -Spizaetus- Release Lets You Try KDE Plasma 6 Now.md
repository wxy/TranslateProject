Garuda Linux “Spizaetus” Release Lets You Try KDE Plasma 6 Now!
======
The latest upgrade to Garuda Linux brings in some interesting changes
and a new ISO offering.
Garuda Linux is a popular, [user-friendly Arch Linux-based distro][1] **** that has gained a sizeable following lately thanks to its customizable and extensible nature.

It is known to provide various options to suit different use cases, from programming to gaming.

Now, its latest release, **Garuda Linux “Spizaetus”** is here.

Allow me to take you through the release.

## 🆕 Garuda Linux “Spizaetus”: What's New?

![][2]

The release takes its code-name “[Spizaetus][3]” from a hawk-eagle bird typically found in the tropics of the Americas. Some **key highlights** of this release include:

  * **Hyprland ISO Offering**
  * **Ugrep Replaces Grep**
  * **Experimental KDE Plasma 6 Repo**

### Hyprland ISO Offering

![][5]

A new ISO has debuted with this release of Garuda Linux that features the '[Hyprland][6] **'** dynamic tiling Wayland compositor, which makes way for **smooth animations** and **effortless window tiling**.

On this, one of the developers, **dr460nf1r3** , added:

> Being focused on fancy looks and blurry windows, it is certainly a good fit for Garuda.

🚧

Sadly, they have ****had to drop a few editions**** , citing concerns that they were not being maintained properly. The affected ones include: ****MATE**** , ****LXQt-Kwin**** , ****KDE-git**** , and ****Wayfire****.

### Ugrep Replaces Grep

The '[grep][7]' command line utility has been replaced with the better performing '[ugrep][8]' file pattern searcher that claims to be an “ **ultra-fast, user-friendly grep replacement** ”.

This is an interesting change, and we'll see how users like it.

### Experimental KDE Plasma 6 Repo (Be Cautious!)

The developers have also introduced an experimental repo in the form of the '[chaotic-aur-kde][10]' repo for providing access to **early builds of Plasma 6**.

Do keep in mind this is for users who want to test out the Plasma 6 experience, and is **not recommended for production use**.

One of the developers added:

> There have been ongoing efforts to provide early builds of Plasma 6 via a dedicated chaotic-aur-kde repo.

> This basically allows testing out how Plasma 6 is going to be - the initial release of it is scheduled for February 2024. Needless to say, these are experimental master branch builds, so only adventurous people should embark the journey.

### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

Those were just the highlights, here are some other refinements worth noting:

  * The **'garuda-update' utility has been updated** to handle conflicts that cropped up due to recent package name changes.
  * [Plymouth][11] **has been removed** , the terminal output will now show up instead during boot.
  * Various **updates to their infrastructure** to better serve users.
  * A dedicated [Lemmy instance][12] for Garuda Linux.
