Woah! Broadcom Could Acquire VMware for $60 Billion
======
Broadcom’s interested to acquire VMware for $60 billion, making it one of the biggest tech deals in 2022.

![broadcom][1]

Broadcom, a semiconductor chip company, is infamous among desktop Linux users for the incompatibility issues with its wireless adapter/card and drivers.

And, it is now planning to get into the cloud computing market by acquiring one of the biggest players in the industry, i.e., **VMware**.

VMware is not an open-source company, but it offers some open-source tools and Linux support for its virtualization software.

In this case, **The Wall Street Journal** [reports][2] that Broadcom and VMware can potentially announce this acquisition later this week on Thursday.

### Broadcom to Enter the Cloud Computing Market

[Broadcom][3] should be a familiar name to Linux users when we talk about wireless network chips and their drivers.

And, with the $60 billion deal for [VMware][4], they could expand their take on the industry through VMware’s reach in the cloud computing sector.

So, their decision also influences the talk about the acquisition by Broadcom.

Hence, it is safe to say that the deal may or may not go through if the discussions fall apart.

And, for the payment to succeed, the report also mentions that Broadcom plans to take help of banks for a $40 billion debt package.

Considering that the report mentions the final price is still up for discussion, the $60 billion value can change (but something around it).

### Wrapping Up

You can keep an eye on VMware’s shares and Broadcom Inc if you are someone who is interested in getting involved in the market.

What do you think about Broadcom acquiring VMware? Do you think it’s going to go through with Dell involved with a major stake in the company? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below.
