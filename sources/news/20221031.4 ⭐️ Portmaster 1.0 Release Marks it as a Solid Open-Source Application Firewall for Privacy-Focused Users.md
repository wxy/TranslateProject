Portmaster 1.0 Release Marks it as a Solid Open-Source Application Firewall for Privacy-Focused Users
======

Portmaster is an all-in-one open-source privacy tool that you probably need. Give it a try!

![Portmaster 1.0 Release Marks it as a Solid Open-Source Application Firewall for Privacy-Focused Users][1]

Portmaster by [Safing][2] is a free and open-source application firewall that aims to automate the process of protecting the privacy of its users.

**It allows you to monitor network activity, add custom connection rules for applications, and more.**

We tested it during the alpha stage, and came to the conclusion that it had good potential to act as a viable alternative to [GlassWire][3]. Of course, it may not be a replacement, but it can be one in the near future:

With the release of Portmaster 1.0, we can recommend everyone to give it a try.

> 💡Portmaster 1.0 is a stable release suitable for every user.

### 🆕 Portmaster 1.0: What's New?

![portmaster 1.0][4]

Considering this is Portmaster's first stable release, there could be room for improvement.

However, some of the features that it brings with it include:

- **Easy navigation to monitor app network connections**
- **Secure DNS by default**
- **Automatic blocking of trackers & malware**

#### Automatic Blocking Of Trackers & Malware

![portmaster 1.0 filter lists][5]

Portmaster lets you automatically block various trackers and malware by using well-known filter lists from the likes of [AdAway][6], [abuse.ch][7], [AdGuard][8], and a few of their curated lists.

#### Side-Dash Menu

The presence of sidebar menu in Portmaster makes things easy, meaning it acts as a quick switcher between apps and settings.

It also shows key information regarding apps that are using the network.

Additionally, suppose you are using their [paid SPN service][11] (or Portmaster Unlimited). In that case, you can use the Side-Dash to see which countries each app connects to, alongside the number of identities in use.

#### Other Features

In addition to the key highlights, it also gives you some powerful abilities that include:

- **Choose your favorite DNS-over-TLS provider, like Cloudflare, Quad9, AdGuard, etc., to encrypt DNS requests.**
- **Allow/Block specific websites or applications.**
- **Specify if you do not want your apps to connect to specific countries.**
- **Block all p2p connections.**

### 📥 Download Portmaster 1.0

Portmaster is currently only available for Windows and Linux, with no news on the release of a macOS version.

They plan to support mobile platforms in the future as well.

You can visit its official [downloads page][14] to get started for Linux (.deb/.rpm packages) and Windows.

Explore more about the project on its [GitHub page][15].

### 💭 My Thoughts

Portmaster aims to succeed in a space where GlassWire is a very well-known name. It is easy to use and offers an intuitive experience.

**But, GlassWire is not open-source and does not have a client for Linux.**

With further refinements, I think it would be an impressive addition to every privacy-conscious computer user.

Of course, a free and open-source alternative to any proprietary tool is a good thing, as it enables more users to try it out.

And, Portmaster is something that helps you monitor your network connections and automate your privacy protections, I think you should take it for a spin! 😊

💬 Is Portmaster a good application firewall for your use-case? What do you think about it?
