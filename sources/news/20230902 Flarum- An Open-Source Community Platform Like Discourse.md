Flarum: An Open-Source Community Platform Like Discourse
======
Flarum can be a better, simpler, or an innovative alternative to
Discourse. Learn more about it here.
Another day, another first look 😎

This time, we have an **alternative to the open-source forum software Discourse** called “ **Flarum**.” It aims to offer a **simple (yet customizable) discussion platform for websites** that is free, fast, and easy to use.

Flarum is also **highly extensible** , allowing for significant customization.

Of course, the more open-source options we have, the better, right?

Let's take a look at it and see what it offers.

### Flarum: Overview ⭐

![][1]

Flarum is a **combined successor of the now-defunct** [**esoTalk**][2] **and** [**FluxBB**][3] **forum software** suites. It offers a good feature-set while keeping optimization and fast performance in mind.

Written primarily in the PHP programming language. It is **maintained/governed by volunteers** and **relies on contributions from the community** to fuel its development.

Some of its key highlights include:

  * **Highly optimized**
  * **Responsive User Interface**
  * **Mobile-First approach**
  * **Very flexible**



💡

Flarum and Discourse both have different tech stacks, and both have subtle but useful feature differences.

For instance, Discourse timeline control functionality was inspired by Flarum.

### Initial Impressions 👨‍💻

I started testing by visiting Flarum's [official forum][4] by using my GitHub account to log in.

Post login, I was brought to the **homepage** which featured all the discussions with their relevant tags, and the number of replies on them.

The **header menu** had the usual **search bar** , with options to **check drafts** , **notifications** , **a menu with the username/avatar** , and a **few important settings**.

The homepage also featured a **sidebar menu** with options to start a new discussion, access tags, and view private discussions.

I must say I did find some similarities to Discourse. But, that's not a bad thing at all!

There was a familiar timeline scroller that allowed me to jump to different replies in the post.

![Such a cute little marsupial!][6]

Then there's the “ **Follow** ” button that allows for **three distinct settings**. One was the default, with no notifications, the other was for getting post notifications, and the last one was to ignore a post.

![][7]

Thereafter, I looked at how one could **interact with a post reply**. It had three options, one was to 'Reply' to the post, one was to 'Like' it, and the last one was to 'Flag' it for the moderators to take a look at.

![][8]

The **post-replying experience** was also quite neat, with a live preview being shown above the editor. It also showed options to save the reply as a draft, minimize the editor, go into full-screen editing, and close the editor.

![][9]

Finally, I took a look at the **user settings** , and it includes all the usual settings with fine control over notifications. It also showed what third-party accounts were linked to my Flarum account.

![][10]

Overall, it mimics the comfort that you get with the already-popular Discourse with **useful feature differences and a tech stack that is easy to install and manage.**

Flarum receives updates regularly, and its development has come a long way since it all began. It is also one of the best [open-source forum software][11] for Linux servers, and that shows.

At the moment, they do not offer any premium hosting plans.
