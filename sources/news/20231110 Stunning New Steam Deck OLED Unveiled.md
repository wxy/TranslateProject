Stunning New Steam Deck OLED Unveiled!
======
An all-new Steam Deck with better display and impressive specifications.
The holiday season is almost upon us, and Valve has introduced something to potentially make it more enjoyable!

With a recent announcement, they have shed light on **a new Steam Deck variant** equipped with some exciting upgrades.

Let's take a look at it.

## 🆕 Steam Deck OLED: What's New?

As the name suggests, this variant of the Steam Deck is equipped with **a new 90Hz 7.4” HDR OLED display** that can go to a **1,000 nits peak brightness for HDR** , and **600 nits for SDR**.

This **display should provide gamers with deeper blacks and brighter colors** when compared to the existing LCD-equipped model.

However, the **display is not the only highlight** of this new Steam Deck variant. The processor also sees an upgrade, with **a more efficient 6 nm AMD “Sephiroth” APU** now taking care of all the processing on board.

To compliment the above-mentioned, the Steam Deck OLED comes equipped with a **larger 50Whr battery** to provide you a good battery life.

On the connectivity side of things; **Wi-Fi 6** and **Bluetooth 5.3** are being offered for **a better downloading experience**.

📋

A 45W USB Type-C PD3.0 power supply with a 2.5m cable is provided for recharging the battery.

Even the **controls have been improved** , the top material and shape for the analog stick was improved for better grip/dust resistance, better responsiveness and tactile feedback from the shoulder buttons, and more.

The **operating system is the same Steam OS 3** found on the LCD model, but, if you were in the market to experiment something different, you could give [Bazzite][1] a try.

### 🛠️ Key Specifications

If you're wondering, here's what's powering the newly launched Steam Deck OLED:

  * **APU:** 6 nm AMD “Sephiroth”
  * **CPU:** 4-core, [Zen 2][3] @2.4–3.5 GHz
  * **GPU:** 8x [RDNA 2][4] CUs @1.6 GHz
  * **RAM:** 16 GB LPDDR5
  * **Storage:** 512 GB or 1 TB NVMe SSD

**But, wait, there's more!**

Valve has also launched **a Limited Edition Steam Deck OLED** , which features all the same tech specs with the 1 TB storage, **a transparent case and a smoky translucent colorway.** Take a look for yourself. 👇

It looks really cool. I like what many manufacturers are doing now with their devices; going transparent for the outer casing. A good trend, perhaps.

Valve has mentioned that this will be **available in limited quantities** for buyers in the United States and Canada only.

The reason behind such a limited rollout is that **they are experimenting** to see whether there is a large demand for such a product, they intend to experiment with more colorways in the future.

## 🛒 Where to Buy?

**Pricing starts at $549** , you can buy Steam Deck OLED from the [Steam Store][7], November 16 onwards.

Just keep in mind that it is not available in all the regions where Steam operates.
