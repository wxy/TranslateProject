Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS Arrives with Automatic Updates, GNOME 42, and PipeWire
======

The next LTS upgrade for Pop!_OS is finally here.

Pop!_OS 22.04 is based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with [Linux Kernel 5.16.19][1] at the time of launch.

Let us take a brief look at what it has to offer.

### Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS: What’s New?

Visually, it does not feature any massive changes. However, it does feature **GNOME 42** as its base for its COSMIC Desktop.

So, you should expect to see some [GNOME 42 features][2] available with Pop!_OS 22.04.

In addition to the desktop environment, there are a few new feature additions. I shall mention the key highlights as you read on.

#### Automatic Updates

With Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS, you can easily update/upgrade the system from the OS Upgrade &amp; Recovery panel via the System settings.

You can also schedule the day/time to process the upgrade. The scheduled automatic updates include support for Debian, Flatpak, and Nix packages as well. Surely, this should help save time by eliminating the need for checking updates every other day.

By default, you will be notified of the available updates on a weekly basis. But, you can tweak the settings to get notified every day or each month. The notifications will be turned off if you have automatic updates enabled.

And, yes, the automatic updates are disabled by default. You will have to set it up if you require it.

#### New Support Panel

![][5]

Unlike other distributions, Pop!_OS tries to take a mainstream approach to provide technical support for users running the operating system.

To give clarity, they have added a new support panel in the settings where you can quickly access the documentation, join the community support, and create log files. These options should make the support options accessible, and encourage users to refer the recommended sources for quick support.

#### New Screenshot Tool

![][6]

Thanks to GNOME 42, you get the brand new screenshot UI with the ability to record the screen as well.

With Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS, I found the positioning of the UI a bit weird. And, it looks like they tweaked it a bit for a transparent look with slightly different icons.

#### Dark vs Light Backgrounds

![][7]

Unlike other distributions, you won’t find a new wallpaper collection to cater to the light/dark variants.

However, when you choose the light/dark theme, the wallpaper will change to the default light/dark variants available.

Do note that the light/dark mode can have independent backgrounds (you can change them) and isn’t locked to the default.

#### Improvements to the Pop!_Shop

The Pop!_Shop has received some significant performance upgrades along with subtle changes to offer a good user experience even with small window sizes.

![][8]

You will also find a new “**Recently Updated**” section to highlight the latest updated applications.

This should come in handy to find applications that have been recently updated with new features/fixes.

#### Improvements to the Launcher

![][9]

With Pop!_OS, you do not need a launcher like [Ulauncher][10] to quickly access the settings/apps.

This is because you already get a built-in launcher that works pretty well.

With Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS, the launcher has also received some upgrades where you can also access settings for desktop options, background, appearance, dock, and workspaces.

#### PipeWire for Audio

With Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS, the default for audio processing will use PipeWire instead of PulseAudio.

This should not pose a problem for hardware compatible with PulseAudio, and potentially opens up for better quality audio, and more customizations.

#### Linux Kernel

![][11]

It is a no-brainer that Pop!_OS regularly updates the Linux Kernel offered. However, you will find [Linux Kernel 5.16.19][1] with all the hardware improvements out-of-the-box.

#### Other Improvements

![][12]

There are some additional essential improvements that can be useful for a variety of users. Some of them include:

  * Better Multi-Monitor support
  * Fixed layout on HiDPI displays
  * Improved performance
  * Pop!_OS Upgrade will only activate when you are checking or performing upgrades.
  * When updating Debian packages, you get the ability to resume it if interrupted.
  * Added support for laptop privacy screens.
  * RDP by default for remote desktop use.
  * New default profile icon.
  * Workspace improvements.
  * Icons are now SVG-based instead of PNG-based.



### Download Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS

If you are already running Pop!_OS, you should be easily able to upgrade it to Pop!_OS 22.04 in some time.

In either case, you can download the latest Nvidia/Intel/AMD ISO from the [official site][13].
