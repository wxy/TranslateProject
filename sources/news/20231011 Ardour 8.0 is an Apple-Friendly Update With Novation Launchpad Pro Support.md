We now have a major upgrade for the DAW. **Ardour 8.0** release comes almost a year after its [7.0 release][2] as a significant evolution in its development lifecycle.

Let's see what it has to offer.

## 🆕 Ardour 8.0: What's New?

![][4]

Ardour 8.0 promises a plethora of new features and big fixes.

And, with this release, the developers have also stressed that there are **no changes to Ardour's session file format** , so sessions created in the older versions of Ardour, from the 7.x series, should load without any issues.

Some key highlights include:

  * **Support for Novation Launchpad Pro**
  * **Redesigned MIDI Track Header**
  * **MIDI Velocity Improvements**
  * **Region Grouping Support**
  * **Notarization for macOS**



### Support for Novation Launchpad Pro

![][5]

Ardour 8.0 features support for Novation's [Launchpad Pro,][6] which is an electronic music instrument that consists of an 8×8 grid of RGB, velocity-sensitivity pads that can be used to accomplish various tasks.

With Ardour, it can be used to **trigger clips and clues** , **control gain levels** , **panning** , and even **send levels for tracks/busses**.

### Redesigned MIDI Track Header

![][7]

A **completely resigned MIDI track header** is here that features a couple of interesting changes. The most notable ones include:

  * Octave numbers like C3, C4 are now shown at all times.
  * It is now possible to record MIDI using the piano roll.
  * A more intuitive design approach for the scroomer (scroll+zoom).
  * Note names can now be displayed in the scroomer, it can either use MIDNAM data, generic note numbers or 12TET names.



### MIDI Velocity Improvements

After receiving many requests by users over time, the devs of Ardour have finally added **a traditional velocity lollipop interface**.

This interface consists of vertical bars with a dot on top that can be used to change the note velocity. I suggest you go through the video above to know more about its implementation in Ardour 8.0.

### Region Grouping Support

![][8]

Similarly, this was also a long-time requested feature by users. ' **Region Grouping** ', gives you the ability to select multiple [Regions][9] and group them into a single element.

These can then be moved/trimmed together to decrease the repetitive task of doing that for each element in the Region.

### Notarization for macOS

When you install third-party software on Apple computers, it warns you that it can damage your system or include malware. Of course, for users unaware, this could be a bad user experience, and they may not proceed trying it out.

Ardour decided to join and pay for an Apple Developer account to utilize its [Notarization][10] system.

So, next time you install Ardour on macOS, it will indicate that it has been verified/checked by Apple for malware, giving users more confidence in it.

### 🛠️ Other Changes

Here are a few other changes with this release:

  * Support for freehand automation drawing.
  * Inclusion of three new MIDI arpeggiator plugins.
  * A dedicated ruler feature to arrange a composition.
  * Various improvements for BBT markers.



You can go through the [official release notes][11] to learn more about this release.
