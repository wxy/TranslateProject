Librum: Promising New Open-Source e-book Reader That Lets You Create an Online Library
======
Librum is a new eBook reader with a cloud library.
Are you a bookworm? Or turning into one?

Well, we have just the thing for you!

Librum Reader is a new eBook reader offering meant to “ _make reading enjoyable and straightforward for everyone_.”

While this is not your usual offline reader app, it can be one of the [best eBook readers for Linux][1]. With Librum, you can **take advantage of the cloud** by having a personal library that can be accessed from any device, anytime.

Allow me to show you around it.

### Librum: Overview ⭐

![][2]

Built primarily using **QML** and **C++** , Librum is an **open-source e-book reader** that allows you to sync your content to the cloud with a pretty straightforward interface.

It is free to get started with **2 GB of cloud storage** and plans to offer some premium tiers (not yet finalized).

🚧

Librum Reader is in active development and has no stable release yet.

Librum is also packed with plenty of features, with some of the highlights including:

  * **Customizable library**
  * **Metadata editing of books**
  * **Cloud syncing**
  * **Modern interface**



**Suggested Read** 📖

#### Initial Impressions 👨‍💻

I set out to test Librum on my [Ubuntu 22.04][4]-powered system. But, before I could use the app, I **had to create an account** by providing an email address and password.

Even though Librum focuses on providing a cloud experience, I **would've liked a dedicated offline-only mode** as an alternative or a trial mode to check Librum out before signing up.

Anyway, I moved on and signed in to the application. I imported a few books by using the ' **Add books** ' option, and it then arranged them in the home tab neatly, with options to sort, filter, or add tags to them.

The **eBook reading experience** was just about what you would expect from a modern reader application, with a minimal interface and options to scale the text, go into full-screen mode, and more.

![][6]

The **three-ribbon menu houses a few essential options**. The top three options allow you to print, save, or share the currently opened eBook.

The options include the **text-to-speech functionality** , **displaying pages continuously/vertically** , **inverting the colors** , **syncing the book** , and **accessing the settings menu.**

![][7]

I also tested out **the** **search functionality;** I could quickly find specific words, with options to highlight them all, set it to be case-sensitive, and search for whole words.

![][8]

The **table of contents** feature also worked quite well, with the option to search for specific chapters using the search bar.

![][9]

That was it for my eBook reading experience on Librum Reader.

But wait, **there's more to look out for!**

#### Proposed Upcoming Features 📝

![][10]

I noticed that there were plenty of features that were still being worked on.

One of those is **a free in-app bookstore** that is **set to house over 70,000 eBooks;** the other is a ' **Statistics Page** ' that will contain **personalized reading statistics.**

The last one is an ' **Add-ons Page** ' that will most likely feature **add-ons that further enhance the functionality of Librum**.

![][11]

The stable release is set to arrive in the coming months.

The **developers have not yet clarified what the upcoming paid plans will offer**. My best guess would be that they will offer more cloud storage and access to novelty features.

I suggest you watch their [news page][12] for up-to-date information regarding Librum Reader.

### 📥 Get Librum

Librum is **available as a Flatpak for Linux** right now, with **Windows** and **macOS** variants under development.

Head over to the [official website][13] or the [Flathub store][14] to grab it.
