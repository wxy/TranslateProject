Geany 2.0 Release Makes it a More Versatile Text Editor and IDE
======
Geany 2.0 arrives with new filetypes and other refinements.
[Geany][1] is regarded as one of the [best Python IDEs for Linux][2], it is **an open-source, lightweight IDE** based on the GTK3 toolkit.

It can also be counted as one of the [alternatives to Notepad++ on Linux][3] considering Geany's feature-set appeals to variety of users.

Now, a new release has been introduced in the form of ' **Geany 2.0** ' that offers many improvements.

Let's see what is in store.

## 🆕 Geany 2.0: What's New?

![][4]

The highlights of this Geany release can be divided into two distinct sections, which cover mostly the interface and better support for filetypes.

### Filetype Upgrades

The filetype configuration for **Kotlin** was improved with updates to the [basic types][5]. Similarly, for **Python** , the standard library tags creation script was rewritten for Python 3 and support was improved for the **ctags** file format.

And finally, **support for new filetypes** such as [**AutoIt**][6] and [**GDScript**][7] were added to Geany, and the filetype configs for **Nim** and **PHP** updated for addressing some long-standing issues.

### Interface Improvements

![][8]

Geany 2.0 features **a new tree view** in the sidebar for the documents list. It is enabled by default, so you don't have to do anything.

It is practical when you have numerous individual files to go through. You can also collapse specific folders to minimize the clutter.

![][9]

The **compiler messages now use dark-theme friendly colors** so that you can easily read the messages. This should be helpful during those late-night coding runs.

Furthermore, **a new confirmation dialog** was added to the “search & replace” feature for the whole session, and **an option was added to show symbols in the symbol tree** without the category group.

### 🛠️ Other Changes

Other than the above-mentioned, here are some changes that are worth noting:

  * Geany now requires GTK 3.24.
  * You can now scroll over document tabs.
  * Updated translations for various languages.
