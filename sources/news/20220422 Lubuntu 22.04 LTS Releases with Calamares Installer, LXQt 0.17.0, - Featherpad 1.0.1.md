Lubuntu 22.04 LTS Releases with Calamares Installer, LXQt 0.17.0, & Featherpad 1.0.1
======

Looking for a lightweight Ubuntu distro for your computer as an alternative to GNOME-powered Ubuntu 22.04 LTS?

Lubuntu 22.04 LTS is here as a replacement. In fact, you can also take a look at [Xubuntu 22.04 LTS][1], if you are exploring lightweight options.

Here, we focus on the most exciting changes with Lubuntu 22.04 LTS.

### Lubuntu 22.04 LTS: What’s New?

Lubuntu 22.04 LTS comes packed with LXQt 0.17.0, updated applications, and some improvements.

It is a [Long-Term Release][2] version. So, you can expect updates for Lubuntu 22.04 LTS until 2025, i.e., **three-year support**, which is usual for [official Ubuntu flavours][3].

Some of the significant changes include:

#### New Wallpaper

Everyone loves a new wallpaper. With various Ubuntu flavours like [MATE][4], [Kubuntu][5], and [Budgie][6] releases, you have got plenty of new wallpapers.

With Lubuntu 22.04, there is an interesting wallpaper that you can find on [Unsplash][7]:

#### LXQt 0.17.0 (Can Upgrade to LXQt 1.1.0)

While LXQt 0.17.0 includes essential improvements, it would have been more exciting to see the recent [LXQt 1.1.0][9]. Considering it was released last week, it did not make the cut in this release.

However, they could have gone with LXQt 1.0.0 at least.

LXQt 0.17.0 includes improvements to the session behavior for non-LXQt apps, power manager updates, an auto-hide feature added to the LXQt panel, and further adjustments.

For details on LXQt 0.17.0, you can refer to its [official release notes][11].

The LXQt project team on Twitter [mentioned][12] that it is possible to easily install LXQt 1.1.0 on Lubuntu. I tried it on a virtual machine, so you can give it a try if you like.

All you have to do is add the following repository and then upgrade the system:

```

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:severusseptimius/lxqt
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade

```

I did not have any issues with it. However, I am uncertain if Lubuntu recommends it yet (or they may push an update soon).

#### Firefox as Snap

Unfortunately, every Ubuntu flavour does include Firefox as a snap package, considering Mozilla will be focusing on the Snap for faster updates and maintenance.

In a good way, you should experience enhanced security with its sandboxing.

The release notes mention that the browser can be slower to start for the first time after boot, especially in the live environment. But you shouldn’t have trouble with subsequent runs.

#### Package Updates

With Lubuntu 22.04 LTS, you get upgrades to various applications that include:

  * VLC 3.0.16
  * Featherpad 1.0.1
  * LibreOffice 7.3.2



Along with the applications, you also get an update to the Discover Software Center for a smoother experience with managing/installing software.

#### Calamares Installer

Lubuntu 22.04 LTS utilizes the Calamares installer in place of Ubiquity, as favored by most of the other Ubuntu flavours.

You get the swapfile size set to 512 MB by default. But, you can opt for no swap, if you like.

#### Dropping Trojita/k3b/fcitx

Some of the popular packages like Trojita (mail client), k3b, and fcitx are no longer present in Lubuntu 22.04 LTS.

So, if you are upgrading, you can manually install it using their [official guide][14].

To explore more about the changes in Lubuntu 22.04 LTS, you can refer to the [official release notes][15].

### Download Lubuntu 22.04 LTS

_If you are upgrading from Lubuntu 20.04 LTS that has LXQt, this new version uses a different Openbox settings configuration file._

_If you have customized, `~/.config/openbox/lxqt-rc.xml` you will want to copy that file to `~/.config/openbox/rc.xml`. This change does not impact new installations and upgrades from 21.10._

To perform a fresh installation, you can get the latest ISO from the official website (direct link/torrent available).
