Ubuntu Core 22 is Here for IoT and Edge Devices
======
Based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu Core 22 brings the best of security and performance for IoT and embedded devices.

![ubuntu][1]

Ubuntu Core 22 is a containerized Ubuntu 22.04 LTS variant optimized for embedded and IoT devices.

It should be a wonderful offering for developers looking to make use of Canonical’s latest operating system for edge devices.

To address the Ubuntu Core 22 release, **Mark Shuttleworth**, CEO of Canonical, said:

> “Our goal at Canonical is to provide secure, reliable open-source everywhere – from the development environment to the cloud, down to the edge and to devices,”.

### Ubuntu Core 22: What’s New?

![What is Ubuntu Core 22?][2]

With Ubuntu Core 22 release, you get improvements focused on security and reliability. Some of them include:

#### Real-time Compute

As the announcement mentions, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS provides a real-time kernel (which is available in beta), delivering high performance, ultra-low latency, and workload predictability fit for time-sensitive industrial, automotive, and robotics use cases.

Furthermore, if you have Ubuntu-certified hardware, you should be able to fully utilize advanced real-time features.

#### Snapcraft Framework

The entire Ubuntu image breaks down as packages (Snaps), making the kernel, OS, and the applications isolated in a sandbox.

This should let you easily install applications without needing to worry about dependencies from the dedicated IoT App Store. For enterprises, software management solutions through the App Store should enable a range of on-premise opportunities.

The framework also helps the system ensure the OTA updates work as expected, and do not break anything even if it fails for some reason.

#### Security

Out of the box, Ubuntu Core provides advanced security features that include secure boot, full-disk encryption, and more fit for mission-critical environments.

Note that you also get 10 years of security update commitment with this release.

#### Other Key Improvements

* Easy migration from Ubuntu Core 20 and ensuring backward compatibility.
* Performance improvements.
* A new factory reset boot mode, to factory reset from run/recovery modes.
