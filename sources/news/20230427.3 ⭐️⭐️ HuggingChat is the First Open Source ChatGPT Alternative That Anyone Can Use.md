HuggingChat is the First Open Source ChatGPT Alternative That Anyone Can Use
======

Forget ChatGPT. Focus on HuggingChat, the open-source project.

![huggingchat][1]

The wave of new AI chatbots is not stopping anytime soon; another contender has jumped into the ring with ChatGPT.

Released recently, it's called '**HuggingChat**.' The main focus of this chatbot is to provide a more **transparent**, **inclusive,** and **accountable****alternative to ChatGPT**.

Don't get me wrong, HuggingChat is not the first open-source alternative to ChatGPT. We have covered open-source projects challenging ChatGPT.

⭐ However, **HugginChat seems to be the first one available to access as a platform that appears similar to ChatGPT**.

So, you are not using just a demo, you are already using what it is supposed to look and behave like - only the backend will get an upgrade as you test/use it.

Let's see what HuggingChat is all about.

**What is it:** So, basically in its current state, HuggingChat acts as a user interface that facilitates interaction with the **Open Assistant-powered back-end** allowing for chatbot functionality.

> 📋 [Open Assistant][2] is a project that aims to provide the masses with a feasible chat-based large language model (LLM).

HuggingChat is powered by Open Assistant's latest [LLaMA-based model][4] which is said to be one of the best open-source chat models available in the market right now.

But there's a catch to that model's usage in HuggingChat.

You see, the [LLaMA model][5] is the work of **Meta AI**, and they have restricted any commercial use of their model.

So, the LLaMA model will be used for now, and the **developers intend to add support for more models** in the future, paving the way for varying usage scenarios and even enterprise use cases.

Besides that, the chatbot is running in what the folks over at [Hugging Face][6] (the creators of HuggingChat) call '[Space][7]'. The inference backend is also running [text-generation-inference][8] on their Inference API infrastructure.

They have also open-sourced the user interface of HuggingChat. You can take a [look][9] here.

**Does it work?**

Well, sort of.

As it is in a **very early development stage (version 0)**, a few key features are missing, such as saving the conversation over a browser restart or when switching browsers.

Then there are familiar “_Too much traffic, try again later_” errors that pop up while running chat commands.

When I could run a command, I asked HuggingChat about its back end. It provided me with decent info about itself.

So, wrapping up.

Hugging Chat is not yet close to the levels of ChatGPT, but **alternatives like these are the need of the hour; we** all know what happens when one service dominates a specific niche.

[OpenChatKit][11] or [Dolly][12] can be some other options that you can look at.

But for now, all we can do is wait. These open-source alternatives will need some time, but someday they might be on par with ChatGPT or even better; who knows? 😲

**Want to try it?**

You can take HuggingChat for a run by visiting the [chat page][13]; also look at the code that makes it run on the [official website][14].
