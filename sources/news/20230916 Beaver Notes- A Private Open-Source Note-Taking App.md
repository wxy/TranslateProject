Beaver Notes: A Private Open-Source Note-Taking App
======
A privacy-focused note-taking app available cross-platform. Let's take a
look at it!
Are you looking for a privacy-focused, note-taking app?

Well, then, we stumbled upon just the right thing for you!

Beaver Notes is an **open-source, cross-platform note-taking app** that **stores notes locally** , foregoing any risk of data breaches and allowing for offline access to the stored notes.

I think it can make its way to our list of [best note-taking apps for Linux][1] soon.

Allow me to take you through this app; I also share my initial impressions below.

### Beaver Notes: Overview ⭐

![][2]

Built using a combination of **Vue** and **JavaScript** , Beaver Notes is a **privacy-first** note-taking app that offers a simple and intuitive user interface.

It offers plenty of features that make it a pretty solid option for a note-taking app. Some of the notable highlights include:

  * **Focus Mode**
  * **Note Tagging System**
  * **Markdown Editing**
  * **Ability to Export/Import notes**

#### Initial Impressions 👨‍💻

After installing it on my [Ubuntu 22.04][4] system, I populated Beaver Notes with a few random notes and the two introduction notes it already came with.

When I launched Beaver Notes, I was taken to the homepage that featured many things. One was a **neatly organized section with all my notes;** then there was the **search menu with note-sorting options** beside it.

The last thing was **a sidebar menu** that **housed important options** for creating/editing a new note, accessing all/archived notes, toggling dark mode, and the settings menu.

I then went on to look at the **note-editing experience**.

As mentioned earlier, **Beaver Notes has support for** [**Markdown**][6], and my editing experience with it was pretty intuitive; it gave me all the usual options that one would expect from an editor like this.

Interestingly, it also features a ' **Focus Mode** '. When enabled, it hid all the menu elements and took me into full-screen mode for a more immersed editing experience.

While the feature puts you into full-screen mode, I exited it to take the following screenshot.

Another feature that caught my eye was the ' **Headings Tree** ' feature. This made it effortless to navigate around larger notes that consisted of many headings.

![][9]

Beaver Notes also has a **note tagging system** that lets you organize your notes more effectively. Simply add an '#' with the tag name, and a new tag will be created.

Thereafter, you can sort it using the tag sorting menu near the search bar or by clicking on the tags on the homepage.

![][10]

You can also **archive notes**. **** Instead of deleting a note, I could archive one and access it from the dedicated 'Archive' option on the sidebar menu for later use.

![][11]

What about customizing its appearance?

The ' **Settings'** menu features the usual options to change the app theme between 'Light', 'Dark', and 'System'.

It also lets you export data with/without a password, as well as the ability to import notes.

![][12]

Finally, we have the 'Shortcuts' menu that shows all the keyboard shortcuts available to use on Beaver Notes.

![][13]

In my brief usage, Beaver Notes seems like a solid note-taking option, especially if you don't want any form of cloud syncing involved.

I suggest you try it, as it offers plenty of valuable features.
