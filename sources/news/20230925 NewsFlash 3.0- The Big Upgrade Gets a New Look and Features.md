NewsFlash 3.0: The Big Upgrade Gets a New Look and Features
======
The modern newsreader app for Linux gets a super upgrade.
NewsFlash is a neat program that allows you to follow your favorite news sites and blogs. As a spiritual successor to the now defunct [FeedReader][1], it integrates well with many existing web-based RSS readers (like Inoreader and Feedly), and also has support for local feeds.

Not to forget, NewsFlash is one of the [best feed reader apps for Linux][2] desktop.

With NewsFlash 3.0 upgrade, there are many important improvements to the app.

## 🆕 NewsFlash 3.0: What's New?

![][3]

NewsFlash features **a tweaked interface layout** with the use of libadwaita 1.4's 'split views' and 'toolbar views'.

This has resulted in **a borderless header bar** , with **3 columns slightly differing in appearance**. The re-sizing behavior has also improved for the sidebar and article list.

Similarly, the **article list has been improved** with the use of GTK 4.12's 'listview' sections, and the articles are now grouped by day/date.

However, those are not the only highlights of this release, here are some notable ones:

  * **Better Performance**
  * **Improved Thumbnails**
  * **Drag and Drop Functionality**
  * **Image Viewer**



### Better Performance

NewsFlash 3.0 is **a lot faster now,** thanks to the implementation of the [Tokio runtime][4], this has allowed for asynchronous processing on a single Tokio runtime instance.

In simple words, the app is snappier, as it handles requests in a more optimized manner. So, actions like syncing, marking articles as read, and scraping full article content are now much faster.

### Improved Thumbnails

![][5]

A **heuristic process** has been added to NewsFlash that now handles the generation of thumbnails from the articles on the feed.

It is supposed to gather a “relevant” image from the article's HTML code, and use that as a thumbnail.

However, as you can see with our [Element X][6] news article, it grabbed an image from within the article, instead of getting the featured image. This should get better with future updates.

**Suggested Read** 📖

### Drag and Drop Functionality

You can now drag/drop elements on the sidebar to move a feed from one category to another and reorder the list.

### Image Viewer

![][8]

With NewsFlash 3.0 you can now click on images in an article to view them in a **dedicated image viewing window**. The same is used to display image attachments of articles.

### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

As for the other changes, here are some technical refinements:

  * Added support for [Commafeed][9].
  * Subscribing to feed on mobile has been improved.
  * NewsFlash now remembers the window state on app restart.
  * The “edit” dialog has been improved with better support for special characters and symbols.



You can go through the [official blog post][10] by the developer to explore some technical details for this release.
