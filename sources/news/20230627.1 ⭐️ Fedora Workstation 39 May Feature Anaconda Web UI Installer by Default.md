Fedora Workstation 39 May Feature Anaconda Web UI Installer by Default
======

The new Anaconda Web UI installer could debut with Fedora Workstation 39.

Fedora's installation experience has remained unchanged for quite a while now.

However, the new Web UI installer, which has been in the works for over a year, is now closer to implementation than ever before.

**Why now?**

When we last [looked][2] at the upcoming **Anaconda WebUI installer**, the progress was quite good.

But now, a **change proposal has finally been filed** to **add the installer to Fedora Workstation** to provide a modern user experience. The proposal is pending review from the Fedora Engineering and Steering Committee (FESCo).

Let's look at the upcoming installer and the proposal, taking a second peek, and when to expect it to arrive with a Fedora release.

### Anaconda WebUI: Overview ⭐

The **existing installer for Fedora uses an old GTK3 base**, known for being **inefficient** and **insecure** in numerous instances. The new Anaconda WebUI installer aims to mitigate that.

It uses a **modern backend with a PatternFly-based user interface** developed by the Anaconda team.

The backend consists of [Python][4], [DBus][5], [Cockpit][6], and [React][7]/[PatternFly][8]. These are set to address many known UX issues from the get-go and have made way for a consistent install experience.

The change proposal also mentions a few key highlights of the new UI that include the following:

- **Wizard solution instead of hub and spoke.**
- **New welcome screen to select language (will be preselected from a language configured in the system).**
- **Timezone and date configuration.**
- **Disk selection**
- **Guided partitioning**
- **Review Configuration**
- **Installation progress**
- **Build-in help**

The primary focus is on presenting a wizard-like experience with more information to the users and helping them better along the installation process.

That's a lot of additions to the new installer; it sounds like a good user experience change! 😃

**So, when can we expect this?**

As this change is subject to approval by FESCo, it all depends on how the voting process goes.

But, I am pretty confident that this change will be approved, as the [change proposal][9] has set a **targeted release of the new Anaconda WebUI installer with Fedora 39**.

_💬 It's only a matter of time before this change is approved; what do you think of it?_
