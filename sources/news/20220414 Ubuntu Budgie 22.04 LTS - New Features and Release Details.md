Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS – New Features and Release Details
======
A LIST OF NEW FEATURES IN THE UBUNTU BUDGIE 22.04 LTS RELEASE.
Ubuntu Budgie is the official Ubuntu flavour that features the Budgie Desktop Environment. It is uniquely designed to give you an alternative desktop experience while depending upon the GNOME stack. Written in C and Vala, the Budgie desktop uses GTK 3.x series for its components.

### Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS – New Features

[Ubuntu 22.04 LT][2]S is the base for Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS, which features the [Linux Kernel 5.15 LTS][3] and underlying base packages. The Linux KErnel 5.15 brings proper support for all the latest CPU, GPU and SoC lineup from the popular manufacturers. Let’s take a look at the Budgie core improvements in this release.

Firstly, this release brings the latest Budgie 10.6 series which brings several improvements since the last LTS version of Ubuntu Budgie. The major changes include the budgie-indicator-applet, which has now swapped to support ayatana-indicators. Also, ayatana-indicator-applet and ayatana-webmail installation are now possible, supporting desktop notification integration with Evolution and Thunderbird email client.

Secondly, the system tray now looks more professional with proper spacing between the icons, and the app indicator is now shown at the beginning of the system tray.

In addition to that, the GNOME Control Center (settings) is now hidden from the main menu, and the Budgie Control Center replaces it. The Budgie control centre was introduced in version 10.6 onwards, and it gives you the necessary options to configure Budgie desktop components.

Moreover, the desktop layout and appearance get updated WhiteSur icon and GTK themes, GTK4+ compatible Arch themes and the Pocillo icon theme. All the underlying icons and layout themes match with their latest upstream version in this release.

Furthermore, the important Budgie Welcome tool now features both Brave browser and Microsoft Edge as an option to install. And a new Chrome OS desktop layout is available in this release for those who like the Chrome OS layout.

One of the interesting changes in this release is related to the Firefox web browser. Recently Ubuntu made the transition to Firefox Snap instead of the deb version. So, Budgie also removed the deb version of Firefox from this release and added the snap version. But also, Canonical’s Firefox ESR (extended support release) PPA is now a browser option for all supported releases.
