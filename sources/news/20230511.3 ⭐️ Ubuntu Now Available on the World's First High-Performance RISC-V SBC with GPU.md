Ubuntu Now Available on the World's First High-Performance RISC-V SBC with GPU
======

StarFive VisionFive 2 can now benefit from the latest and greatest Ubuntu release, improving RISC-V board experiences.

Single-board computers (SBC) have been rising in popularity ever since the likes of **Raspberry Pi**, and **Arduino** came into the spotlight.

These boards are relatively compact and have varying levels of processing power that both tinkerers and hobbyists alike enjoy exploring.

And now.

Canonical has announced that **Ubuntu is available** on the World's first high-performance RISC-V SBC with an integrated GPU, called the **StarFive VisionFive 2.**

Let's dive in and take a look at more details.

**What's Happening:** In a [recent announcement][2], Canonical revealed the end result of their collaboration with [StarFive][3], a Chinese high-tech company specializing **in RISC-V software and hardware**.

The result of this is the **availability of Ubuntu on their latest flagship**, the **StarFive VisionFive 2**, a powerful piece of RISC-V-powered SBC that features an onboard GPU for powering 3D tasks.

This will open up new avenues for RISC-V SBC computing, with users able to implement this in various projects.

Moreover, even in enterprise use cases, these can now be deployed at a large-scale, thanks to Ubuntu.

**Interested in the technical bits?**

The VisionFive 2 is powered by a **StarFive JH7110 64-bit SoC** with a **RISC-V RV64GC processor** with up to 1.5 GHz clock speeds.

You can choose between **2GB/4GB/8GB** memory variants. It has a **TransFlash card slot** for storage purposes, and for video output support, it can handle **HDMI 2.0** and **MIPI-DSI**.

You can dive deeper into the specifications [here][5].

This move by Canonical should help more SBC enthusiasts easily switch to Ubuntu, especially with such a powerful RISC-V-powered SBC.

**Want to try it out?**

You can head to the [official website][6] to grab a preinstalled image of the Ubuntu 23.04 release optimized for VisionFive 2.

_💬 Looking at how things are progressing, we might need to add StarFive VisionFive 2 to our [Raspberry Pi alternatives][7] list. What do you think of that?_
