A New Web Browser For P2P Internet Experience With Secure Messaging and Bitcoin Lightning Network
======

An open-source browser that promises P2P decentralized internet experience with bitcoin integration.

![A New Web Browser For P2P Internet Experience With Secure Messaging and Bitcoin Lightning Network][1]

P2P services for chat, video calls, and document editing are not yet mainstream.

However, the idea for a P2P connection provides better control over the data and security and prevents censorship.

Impervious browser is an exciting initiative that gives you access to P2P tools and a decentralized experience. The tools include:

- **End-to-end encrypted chat.**
- **Encrypted P2P video and audio calls.**
- **Live Docs.**

Additionally, it supports the [Bitcoin lightning network][2], which facilitates instant Bitcoin transactions. If you are a fan of cryptocurrency integrations, this could sound interesting, or it's just another fancy addition for most common users.

### Impervious Browser: How Does it Work?

Technically, the browser is a customized Mozilla Firefox experience. So, you can expect the same features and capabilities.

The browser relies on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), i.e., decentralized digital IDs, to verify a person or connect with them.

Digital Identity

You can find the DID from the settings, which you can share with anyone on the web to add you as a contact.

Once you do that, you can send a message, initiate a video call, and collaborate with the live document feature for any work.

And this is what a conversation looks like:

For users fond of Bitcoin transactions, you can utilize the Lightning network for super-fast payments while in a video call or message conversation.

You need to connect to a lightning node to use the functionality. If you do not have one, Impervious supports creating a [Voltage Lightning Node][6].

I haven't tried it. So, if you are someone who uses cryptocurrency and appreciates the integration while collaborating with people through Impervious's P2P network, it should be a seamless experience.

### Download Impervious

> 💡Impervious is in the Alpha stage. You can download it but it may not work as you would expect.

The Impervious browser is available for Linux and macOS (M1/Intel). They intend to release a Windows build soon.

You can download the latest build from its [GitHub releases section][7] or head to its official website.
