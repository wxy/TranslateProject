Moosync: A Feature-Rich Open-Source Music Player
======
Moosync music player is an interesting cross-platform app for your local
collection and streaming music.
In the mood for listening to some good beats? 🎶

Well, with this first look, we have **a cross-platform, open-source music player** called ' **Moosync** ' that aims to be “a music player for the community”.

Interestingly, we have covered apps like [Harmonoid][1] and [MusicPod][2] in the past, but **those focus mostly on offline use**.

Moosync however, is slightly different. Allow me to show you why.

### Moosync: Overview ⭐

![][3]

Moosync is a music player that has been written primarily in the **Vue** and **TypeScript** programming languages.

It is **highly customizable** and has support for services such as [**YouTube**][4], [**Spotify**][5] and [**LastFM**][6]. Some of its key features include:

  * **Lyrics Support**
  * **Ad-Free Playback**
  * **Local File Support**



#### Initial Impressions 👨‍💻

After I set it up on my Ubuntu system, I started **the quick-setup wizard**.

It took me through many steps to set Moosync up. The first step was to set the location for my music library, from where it would source the local files.

![][7]

Thereafter, I was shown **options to connect to services**.

I **tried connecting my Spotify account** , but **it refused to work** even after I provided Moosync with the required details. Luckily, **this step was optional** , so I skipped it.

![][8]

It then took me to the “ **All Songs** ” tab, which is empty for now as I do not have anything connected nor any local music files.

![][9]

I started populating Moosync by **searching for some songs.** Considering I did not have local or Spotify music, I clicked on the YouTube filter to search for my favorite music.

![][10]

The search feature also includes filters such as Songs, Artists, Playlists, and Albums.

![][11]

I was also able to right-click on individual songs and add them to the queue, or even play them right then. It had several other options too, see for yourself. 👇

![][12]

I tried doing the same while searching the Spotify database, but sadly, I would **have to log in to Spotify for using it on Moosync** , and that, as you know, didn't pan out earlier.

![][13]

📋

I would suggest you to try the [****BlackHole****][14] music app if you are looking for better Spotify support.

Anyway, I moved on to **check out the music player**. It could be accessed either by going into the “Queue” tab, or from the small upwards pointing arrow in the bottom-right of the app.

It had **a very neat layout** with a familiar feel to it.

![][15]

The “ **All Songs** ” tab housed all the songs that I added to Moosync, I had **options to either play from the beginning of the list** , or **add it to the current queue** , and even **play 100 random songs** from it.

![][16]

The “ **Playlists** ” tab had all the playlists that I saved from YouTube. It also provided sorting options between local files and YouTube.

![][17]

The “ **Albums** ” tab had my saved albums, arranged neatly in a grid layout.

![][18]

Similarly, the “ **Artists** ” tab featured the artists I added to my Moosync library. For some reason, it wouldn't load the thumbnails.

I also skipped over the “ **Genres** ” tab as it **didn't seem to function properly**.

![][19]

And finally, the “ **Explore** ” tab that showed me **how many** **minutes of music** I **** listened to.

![][20]

Furthermore, **you can find useful customization settings on Moosync** to tweak your experience.

First up is the “ **Theme** ” settings that let you choose between **three themes** and **two layout views** , with the option to **upload or create a custom theme**.

![][21]

Then there were **numerous extensions** available, one was to **enable rich presence support on Discord** , another to **integrate with Soundcloud** , and more.

![][22]

Not to forget, **Moosync also supports keyboard shortcuts** that could be configured according to personal preference.

![][23]

Moosync has its quirks here and there at the time of writing this, but I think it is a good contender as one of the [best music players for Linux][24].
