openSUSE Wants to Replace Leap With a New Offering
======
openSUSE Leap is set to be replaced with a new option. Learn more about
it here.
Richard Brown, a long-time contributor to the openSUSE project, shared some results from a recent contributor survey.

It was about the interest and feasibility of replacing openSUSE Leap with a new community-built offering. Yes? A replacement to openSUSE Leap?

Interesting news, right? 😳

It's not shocking. The openSUSE team [hinted][1] at Leap being discontinued in **2022** with the introduction of the **Adaptable Linux Platform** (ALP). So, it was expected.

But, what are the options to replace openSUSE Leap with?

### A Derivative of Tumbleweed Likely to Replace Leap

As per the replacement proposal, we have two options:

  * **Linarite** : _A regular old-fashioned release desktop distribution, likely with a narrower package selection than we're used to with Leap unless we find significantly more contributors to be able to support everything_
  * **Slowroll** : _A derivative of Tumbleweed, built automatically as much as possible, using automation and metrics to copy packages from Tumbleweed only after certain conditions (max age, X weeks without change, etc). Basically an attempt to provide something less scary than full speed Tumbleweed._



However, the survey results show a mixed bag of opinions.

Most **users** choose " **Slowroll** " as a viable replacement going forward, which they would like to contribute to.

In contrast, **contributors** voted not to replace openSUSE Leap or use Tumbleweed instead.

But, when choosing one option, the contributors chose " **Linarite** ".

So, the users and existing contributors have different choices.

OpenSUSE decides to go with the users' preference as Slowroll, a rolling release distro. It would need more contributors than what the survey highlights as interested.

Richard also revealed that either of the **two replacements will need more effort than Leap** , and as of now, the **contributors interested in both options are fewer in number when compared to Leap**.

> Leap has struggled even with 61 folk contributing directly to the codebase and backports/PackageHub. And this is when we've had the SLE codebase to borrow from, which dramatically reduced the work required.
>
> Either Slowroll or Linarite would require considerably more packaging and maintenance work than Leap.

He also emphasized that **any Leap replacement should focus on desktop use cases** rather than trying to cater to both server and desktop.

### To Replace or Not?

The [announcement of survey results][2] challenges the community to answer if openSUSE should proceed with replacing Leap or not.

And, if they go ahead, can the community help them support it?
