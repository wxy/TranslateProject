Wow! Raspberry Pi 5 Already Sounds Like a Tinkerer's Favorite! 🤩
======
Tinkerers! Raspberry Pi 5 is here to make your interesting ideas come to
life!
The Single-board computers (SBC) space is livening up again thanks to the launch of a new offering by Raspberry Pi.

Called the ' **Raspberry Pi 5'** , it is an evolution over its very popular predecessor, the Raspberry Pi 4, which was launched back in 2019.

So, let's see what it has to offer and when/where you can get it from.

### 🆕 What's New in Raspberry Pi 5?

The **Raspberry Pi 5 is a sufficiently powerful successor** that has a completely redesigned platform, featuring **in-house designed silicon** developed in the UK.

In comparison to the Raspberry Pi 4, the **Raspberry Pi 5 is over twice as powerful** thanks to the improvements in hardware and software. **** They also added that:

> Compared to Raspberry Pi 4, we have between two and three times the CPU and GPU performance; roughly twice the memory and I/O bandwidth; and for the first time we have Raspberry Pi silicon on a flagship Raspberry Pi device.

Even the form factor doesn't see much of a change**,** with the Raspberry Pi 5 **retaining the** **credit-card sized footprint** , with changes mostly to the placement of ports.

To further complement the release of this SBC, the Raspberry Pi team has been busy readying up **a new release of Raspberry Pi OS**. It is **based on the[Debian 12 'Bookworm'][1] release**, so you can expect loads of improvements.

The updated OS is set to launch in **mid-October 2023** , with a transition to the [Wayfire][2] Wayland compositor system, **doing away with X11**.

### 📝 Raspberry Pi 5: Key Specifications

![][4]

So, you are maybe wondering; what hardware the Raspberry Pi 5 is packing?

Well, for starters, the Raspberry Pi 5 is **powered by a new 16 nm application processor from Broadcom** called ' **BCM2712** '.

It features **a** **quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 processor** running at a nominal **2.4 GHz** , with **512 KB per-core L2 caches** and a **2 MB shared L3 cache**.

All of that is complemented by a new GPU in the form of Broadcom's **VideoCore VII** , with **completely open-source Mesa drivers**.

Then there's the new **'RP1' I/O controller** that **handles various I/O ports** such as the **USB 2.0/3.0** , **Gigabit Ethernet** , **MIPI transceivers** , and the **usual GPIO ports**.

📋

The project RP1 was in progress since 2016, and the venture cost them $15 million. 🤯

And finally, we have the new **'DA9091' power-management IC** by [Renesas][5] that **handles power distribution** around the board with **eight separate switch-mode power supplies** to generate different voltages according to the Raspberry Pi 5's needs.

Other than that, here are some of the other notable highlights:

  * Dedicated Power Button
  * Dual-Band 802.11ac Wi-Fi
  * 4 GB/8 GB Memory Variants
  * 2x 4Kp60 HDMI Display Output
  * 2x 4-lane MIPI camera/display transceivers
  * Bluetooth 5.0 / Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)



Raspberry Pi 5 sounds like something that should enable you to build cool projects, potentially better than existing [Raspberry Pi projects][6].

### Raspberry Pi 5 Accessories 🦾

![Official Raspberry Pi 5 Case Accessory][7]

As is tradition, the Raspberry 5 has launched with various official accessories.

Take for example **the case, which has an integrated fan** , tuned for low noise, and extended usages.

Then there's another cooling accessory in the form of an ' **active cooler** ', that features an aluminum heat sink with a fan that can be directly mounted on to the board.

Owing to the **increased peak power requirements** , they are also offering **a 27 W USB-C power supply** for tinkerers to push their Raspberry Pi 5 to the limits.

There are a few more [Raspberry Pi accessories][9] available that I didn't mention here, like display cables, m.2 hat, and more. I'm sure there could be more in the near future.

I highly suggest you go through the official [announcement blog][10] to get into the finer details of this interesting SBC.

#### 💰 Pricing and Availability

The Raspberry Pi 5 is being offered in **two variants** , and prices start at **$60 for the 4 GB** , and **$80 for the 8 GB variant**.

It is **up for pre-order** through various [approved resellers][11], with shipping to commence by the end of October.

[Raspberry Pi 5 (Approved Resellers)][11]

They have **limited sales to just individual buyers** until the end of this year (2023), to avoid any supply chain issues.
