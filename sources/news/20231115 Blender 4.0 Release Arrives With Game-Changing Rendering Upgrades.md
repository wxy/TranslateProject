Blender 4.0 Release Arrives With Game-Changing Rendering Upgrades
======
Blender 4.0 release makes it an exciting program for all kinds of
graphics professionals and artists.
Blender is **a very popular open-source 3D computer graphics suite** that has a vast variety of use cases, ranging from the creation of animated films, all the way to motion graphics, visual effects, and more.

With a recent announcement, the Blender Foundation revealed the **Blender 4.0 release** , that represents “a major leap for rendering, creating tools, and more to take your Freedom to Create to new heights.”

So, let's look at what's behind this release.

## 🆕 Blender 4.0: What's New?

![][1]

Being a major release, Blender 4.0 has plenty to offer. However, we will be only taking a look at some of the key highlights:

  * **User Interface Improvements**
  * **Light and Shadow Linking**
  * **Revamped Principled BSDF**
  * **Better Rigging**



While we mention some details as you read on, here is the official video to sum up the major changes:

### User Interface Improvements

![][2]

The most important user-facing thing on Blender, the interface font, has been changed to “[Inter][3]”. This **move was made in a bid to improve text readability** across the application, irrespective of the display size.

Then there's the **newly added ability to search** for stuff by pressing the space bar on regular dropdown/context menus, and a tweaked splash screen which now makes it easier to **carry over saved settings** from older Blender installs.

Even a new “ **Save Incremental** ” option was added to the File menu that saves the current _.blender_ file with a numerically incremented name.

### Light and Shadow Linking

![][5]

Dubbed by the devs as their most awaited feature, Blender 4.0 features Light and Shadow Linking. With these features, a designer could **set lights to affect specific objects** in a scene, and even **have control over which objects can block light** , acting as shadow blockers.

For more details on how these work, you can refer to the [official documentation][6].

### Revamped Principled BSDF

![][7]

Blender's [Principled BSDF][8] system has seen a big revamp with the upgrade, it now features **support for a larger variety of material types and is more efficient**.

Some highlights of the revamp include:

  * **Coat** , it is placed above all the base layers, including the emission layer, to simulate things like a phone display behind a glass surface.
  * **Sheen** , it now uses a new microfiber shading model, and acts as the top layer above emission and coat.
  * Implementation of Multiple scattering GGX **** for more efficient rendering in Cycles, resulting in **less power being used while rendering**.
  * **Edge tinting for metallic surfaces** , allowing for an artist-friendly way to render complex index of refraction, based on the F82 tint model.



The illustration below should give you a better look at how things are with this revamp of Principled BSDF:

### Better Rigging

![][10]

Blender 4.0 features a dedicated “ **Bone Collections** ” for [Armature][11] Bones, this implementation is carried over from the existing implementation for objects.

It **replaces both the legacy numbered layers and bone groups feature** , allowing for the Select Grouped operator to select by bone color/collection, setting bone colors on armature bones, and more.

Even the **pose library sees an update** with the recently introduced asset shelf that makes pose assets available in the 3D viewport.

### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

There's more. Some other noteworthy changes include:

  * Support for **Intel HD4000 series GPUs** has been dropped.
  * A new [blendfile compatibility policy][12] has been implemented.
  * **Snapping has been improved** , allowing for faster and more precise snaps.
  * The **minimum required OpenGL version** for Linux and Windows is now 4.3.
  * **Filmic has been replaced** by AgX view transform for better handling of colors in over-exposed areas.
