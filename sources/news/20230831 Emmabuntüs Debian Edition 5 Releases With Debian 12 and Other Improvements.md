## 🆕 Emmabuntüs Debian Edition 5: What's New?

![][5]

Based on the recently introduced **[Debian 12][6]** release, Emmabuntüs Debian Edition 5 is powered by **[Linux Kernel 6.1][7]** , which has resulted in better hardware support, AMD-specific optimizations, and more.

Some key highlights of this release include:

Emmabuntüs uses Xfce as its primary desktop environment, with LXQt as an option. With this release, we are seeing the inclusion of **Xfce 4.18.1** , and **LXQt 1.20.0**.

The distro also features a new Emerald theme, with many wallpapers from Debian and a redesigned logo.

### Performance Improvements

With Emmabuntüs Debian Edition 5, the **startup time in live mode has improved** , the **Calamares installer now works better** with VMware, and the **'os-prober' script** was added for those who want to dual-boot Emmabuntüs with Windows.
