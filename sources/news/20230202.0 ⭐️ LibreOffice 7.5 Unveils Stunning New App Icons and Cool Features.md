======

LibreOffice 7.5 seems to have a new personality with its brand-new app icons and other improvements.

LibreOffice 7.5 community edition is here with **many feature upgrades and new app icons**.

The previous major release [version 7.4][2] bought in better 'interoperability' with Microsoft's proprietary file formats and **further solidified LibreOffice** as one of the [best open-source alternatives to Microsoft Office][3] on Linux.

And now, a new release is here with a lot in store.

Let's take a look at what this has to offer.

Cell inputs with the leading ' apostrophe in cells that are not formatted as Text will now permanently remove the first apostrophe to prevent confusion.

Support for Kamenický and Mazovia encodings was added, alongside improvements to conditional formatting.

In addition, when searching for a term in the Function Wizard, it will now match the function descriptions as well as their names.

#### Impress & Draw Improvements

Impress now has support for adding cropped videos in media shapes and also includes a fix for an EMF graphics issue where it would appear blurry.
