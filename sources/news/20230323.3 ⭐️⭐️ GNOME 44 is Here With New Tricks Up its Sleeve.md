GNOME 44 is Here With New Tricks Up its Sleeve
======

GNOME 44 is finally here with revamped settings, updated quick settings, accessibility improvements, and more.

![gnome 44][1]

GNOME is arguably the **most popular desktop environment**.

The previous [GNOME 43 release][2] was packed with many useful additions, and now the GNOME 44 release follows in the same steps.

Let's see what is on offer.

### üÜï GNOME 44: What's New?

![Introducing GNOME 44][3]

We recently covered the best features of GNOME 44 separately; here, let me give you a recap along with all the release details.

The key highlights include:

- **Settings menu makeover**
- **Quick settings improvements**
- **File chooser grid view**
- **File manager improvements**

#### 1. Settings Menu Makeover

The Settings menu has received a minor makeover, with the **Accessibility panel being redesigned** to provide a more modern navigation experience.

Then, a new feature lets you **share Wi-Fi passwords through a QR code,** and the improved mouse/touchpad settings.

The information under "**Device Security**" has also received updates to add clarity to the technical details.

#### 2. Improved Quick Settings Menu

The quick settings panel has received many updates; it now lets you **view and manage the currently connected Bluetooth devices.**

But you must head to the settings menu to pair a new device.

Another addition is the **new screenshot shortcut** that allows for the effortless capture of screenshots from the quick settings menu.

That is not all; GNOME 44's quick settings menu now features a nifty way of checking **apps running in the background.**

You can find more details on this feature in our previous coverage about it:

#### 3. New Lock Screen/Login Window

GNOME 44 features a **refreshed lock screen and login window** with a bigger user avatar and subtle changes to the various elements, such as the font size for the clock.

#### 4. Thumbnails in GNOME File Picker

Late last year, we [saw the revival][12] of a **long-requested feature** for the GNOME file picker, and now it has finally arrived.

GNOME's file picker never had a proper thumbnail preview for viewing files. Instead, it **relied on a plain list view**.

Until now, that is.

It now **features a proper thumbnail view** that can be toggled by clicking on the 'list-grid view' toggle in the top-right of the file picker.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Other Changes & Improvements

- New wallpapers
- Various minor updates to the File Manager resulted in improved performance.
- Epiphany web browser ported to GTK4 with many bug fixes.
- A new filter has been added to GNOME Software that only shows open-source apps when activated.
- Various improvements to the Contacts app, with the ability to share contacts as QR codes.
- Many UI and styling fixes for GNOME Builder.
- Ten new apps added to the [GNOME Circle][14] collection.

You can go through the [official release notes][15] to learn more.

### Get Started With GNOME 44

You can expect GNOME 44 with Ubuntu 23.04 and Fedora 38 next month.

If you cannot wait to get your hands on it, installing [GNOME OS][16] using [Boxes][17] should be a good way to test it.
