======

Open-source forum software Discourse has a new major upgrade! Check out what's new.

![Discourse 3.0 is an Amazing Release With Much-Needed Feature Additions][1]

Discourse is an open-source forum platform known for its vast features and third-party integrations.

It is also one of the [best open-source forum software][2] you can deploy on your Linux servers to build a community.

The **[It's FOSS Community][3]** forum is **also****powered by Discourse**. If you have any questions or want to join in discussing Linux/Open-Source stuff with like-minded people, feel free to sign up on our community forum.

Now, moving on to Discourse's latest release.

**Discourse 3.0 is finally here**.

This comes almost **five years** after the release of [Discourse 2.0.][4]

This release is packed with plenty of new features and improvements; let me take you through them.

### 🆕 Discourse 3.0: What's New?

Discourse 3.0 has a lot to offer; some of the notable highlights include:

- **New Setup Wizard**
- **User Status**
- **Notifications Menu**
- **New Sidebar**
- **Real-Time Chat**
- **User Tips**

#### New Setup Wizard

![discourse setup wizard][6]

Discourse now features a new setup wizard that lets you quickly configure some of the most important options.

So, options like setting a community to **Private, Invite Only, Require Approval,** and more are shown during the initial stages of the set-up of your forum.

#### User Status

![discourse 3.0 user status][7]

Similar to what most community platforms are doing nowadays, Discourse now has support for setting user status.

Users can set a custom emoji and text to be displayed near their avatar across the platform, be it posts, chat, or in the user card.

#### Notifications Menu

![discourse notifications][8]

Finally, this has become a reality.

Discourse now has a dedicated notifications menu, making it easier to track your activity on the forums.

#### New Sidebar

![discourse 3 sidebar][9]

This is yet **another user experience improvement** that you might like.

You can now add chat channels, tags, and categories to the new sidebar for easy access to the things you want to keep track of.

Admins of forums can also set a default sidebar config for visitors and new members; this way, everyone can get a great outlook of what a forum offers.

#### Real-Time Chat

![discourse 3.0 realtime chat][10]

Discourse now has support for real-time chats; channel admins can choose to create a space for informal discussion, showcase, or even memes if it works for them.

Discourse's **Product Manager**, _Rishabh Nambiar,_mentions:

> Our goal is to empower communities with an integrated experience as conversations shift between faster-paced chat and slower-paced discussions.When ideas are sparked that belong in a more discoverable place, chat messages can be quoted in topics where the discussion can continue over time and allow people in different times and places to join in later.

#### User Tips

![discourse 3.0 user tips][11]

This feature can be helpful to new users who are unfamiliar with Discourse.

Users will be provided with tips related to the features of Discourse when they use a particular feature for the first time.
