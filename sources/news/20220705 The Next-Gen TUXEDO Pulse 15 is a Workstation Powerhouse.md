The Next-Gen TUXEDO Pulse 15 is a Workstation Powerhouse
======

TUXEDO Computers is a German manufacturer popular for offering a wide range of consumer Linux desktops and laptops.

One of their latest notebook releases, the **Pulse 15** – which was introduced two years ago has received a second revision and it sounds like a big upgrade.

### Tuxedo Pulse 15 Gen-2: What’s New?

The notebook’s new 15.6-inch display takes the center stage here. A **2560 x 1440 pixels LED panel** is definitely a huge enhancement compared to the 1080p display used in the previous model. So you can expect clearer and more detailed images, not to mention fluid movements thanks to the high **165Hz refresh rate**!

The AMD Ryzen 5 4600H is now replaced by the year-old **Ryzen 7 5700U**. Offering a total of 8 cores and 16 threads with a boost up to 4.3Ghz clock speed, it should be ideal for heavy workloads.

TUXEDO has optimized the CPU to run at a whopping 35W instead of the maximum recommended 25W. Moreover, a 35% decrease in power consumption compared to the Ryzen 5 4600H has been benchmarked. The integrated AMD RX Vega 8 graphics running at 1900MHz will be slightly more powerful thanks to the increased wattage.

Lastly, the criticisms of the cooling system should be addressed by a new design that features an **“above-average” dual-fan setup** and includes two heat pipes. TUXEDO stated that users shouldn’t come across thermal throttling issues and loud fan noise when at full load.

#### Other Specifications

Despite such big hardware upgrades, the magnesium-chassis laptop weighs only about 1.5Kg with a 1.7cm thickness.

You get two M.2 NVMe slots for storage and two DDR4 memory slots that support up to 3200MHz.

As far as the battery is concerned, the same **91-Wh** battery is being used promising a best estimate of up to 18 hours, varying with usage.

The connectivity options also include a new DisplayPort via USB-C, which was absent with the first-generation model. Other options contain:

  * Intel Dual Band AX 200 (WiFi 6 &amp; Bluetooth 5.2)
  * 1 x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C
  * 2 x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A

  * 1 x HDMI 2.0
  * 1 x Gigabit RJ45 LAN
  * 2-in-1 Headphone &amp; Microphone
  * Kensington Lock
  * UHS-50 Micro SD Cardreader



### Pricing &amp; Availability

The base configuration which includes 8 GB Samsung 3200 MHz DDR 4 RAM and 250 GB NVMe SSD costs **1149 EUR or 1185 USD**. You can choose the flagship TUXEDO_OS 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Kubuntu 22.04 LTS, or Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS as the operating system of your choice.

### Powerful Linux Laptop Lineup

The Tuxedo Pulse 15 specs indicate that it is a solid offering. Thus, developers and business users should not have any complaints regarding its performance.

Not to forget, we also had a recent launch of [HP Dev One][5], and a teaser for [StarFighter][6] with a 4K 10-bit IPS display by Star Labs.

Looks like you’re in for a treat if you are saving up for a premium Linux-specific laptop.
