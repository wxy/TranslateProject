Linus Torvalds Expects to See Rust Support in the Kernel Soon
======
Linux Kernel 5.20 might debut with the Rust infrastructure as hinted by Linus Torvalds. What do you think?

![linus][1]

There are various open-source projects rewritten in Rust. Hence, it is not surprising that is being considered as the second language for Linux Kernel for a while now.

A few days ago at [The Linux Foundation’s Open-Source Summit][2], Linus Torvals mentioned that we should expect the trials for Rust in the next kernel release i.e Linux Kernel 5.20.

In case you did not know, there have been Rust Linux kernel patches already with few sample drivers and the enablement code for the basic infrastructure, as originally reported by [Phoronix][3].

So, Linus Torvalds hinting at a possible merge for the Rust infrastructure should not be a surprise. But, it is certainly exciting!

### Rust for Linux Kernel

While the ultimate goal is to make the Linux Kernel better, it will be considered a trial run for now.

Rust is increasingly becoming a popular programming language for all its benefits. Not to forget, [System76 is also working on a new desktop environment][4] written in Rust.

However, not everyone involved in maintaining the Linux Kernel would be familiar with the programming language.

So, would that be a problem?

Linus Torvalds does not see it as a big issue considering there have been other languages in the kernel as well. He also mentioned that he hopes to see Rust work out as something new.

Overall, he insists that he trusts the maintainers, unless they make a mistake, as reported by [The Register][5].

### Linux 5.20: When?

The Linux Kernel 5.19 release is due around the end of July. So, the merge window for 5.20 should open following its stable release (given there’s no unexpected delays).

Not just for Rust, but Linux Kernel 5.20 should be an important update for next-gen hardware support including RDNA3, and more features.

*What do you think about Rust coming to Linux in the near future? Exicited for it?*
