Mastodon's Growth Continues, Medium Joins in With its New Community Platform
======

Another win for Mastodon's adoption! Medium launches an instance for its users.

![Mastodon's Growth Continues, Medium Joins in With its New Community Platform][1]

Mastodon's growth in recent times has been massive; more and more people are switching to this Twitter alternative than ever before.

If you are not familiar with Mastodon, it is one of the [best mainstream social media alternatives][2] out there, potentially as a replacement for Twitter, which is **completely open-source and decentralized**.

With constant changes to Twitter and last year's takeover by Elon Musk, more users have taken a keen interest in Mastodon as a platform.

Vivaldi [recently launched][3] its Mastodon-powered community, and [Mozilla Foundation][4] is also considering something similar.

Now, [**Medium**][5] has taken a step forward by launching a Mastodon instance.

### Medium Starts a Mastodon-Powered Community

In a [recent announcement][6], Medium launched its Mastodon instance at [me.dm][7], focusing on “_helping their authors, publications, and readers find a home in the Fediverse_”.

The website (or Mastodon instance) aims to be a **dedicated space** for the **users of Medium.**

In other words, itwill be an exclusive social network platform for Medium users.

With the web platform, they are also venturing into short-form writing of 500 characters or less.

The **CEO of Medium** mentions:

> By contrast, Mastodon is primarily for short-form writing of 500 characters or less. Not to be overly punny: Today we are extending what we do into the short-form medium (lowercase m) with an instance on Mastodon, me.dm. Aside from being short-form, Mastodon also brings an important innovation around the concept of federation.

So, it looks like Medium is testing the waters and trying something new.

Probably a good thing for users who prefer bite-sized content instead of lengthy information.

It can work out well for them if done correctly.

**So, how can you join Medium's Mastodon platform?**

> 💡 You see, initially, **only select authors and publications** will be given access to this Mastodon instance.Existing Medium users can try sending a [sign-up request][9], subject to their approval.

So, if you send a signup request, you will have to wait for approval.

They also **plan to invite writers and readers as an additional service****within their paid membership**.

They are already working on a '**sign-up with Medium**' option for their Mastodon instance, which is supposed to make it easy to get started.

On this, they mention that:

> With so many Mastodon instances to choose from, we plan for me.dm to have a few important benefits out of the gate: reliable infrastructure and moderation, a short domain name to make sharing your username easier, better onboarding for new users, and an interesting local feed.

### Decentralized and Open-Source Platforms Picking Up Pace

Decentralized platforms are becoming more popular than one would have expected a decade ago.

The big contributing factor is the number of volatile changes/decisions taken by big tech companies forcing users to constantly adjust how/why they interact on a social media platform.

With an open-source and decentralized platform, users get transparency, more data control, and more freedom.

We may not have expected Mastodon as a platform to gradually become an essential part of community building for various organizations. So, it will be exciting to see what else we have in store for the near future.
