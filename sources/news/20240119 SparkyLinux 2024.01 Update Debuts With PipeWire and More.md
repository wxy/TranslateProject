======
SparkyLinux gets rid of PulseAudio, and adds newer browsers with the
desktop installer.
SparkyLinux is a very [interesting distribution based on Debian][1] that is very fast and lightweight in nature. It provides users with a customizable experience out of the box.

With a recent announcement, the developers have released **the first update of 2024 for their rolling releases of SparkyLinux** that aims to offer various improvements.

Let's dive in and see what's on offer.

Based on the latest packages from the Debian and Sparky testing repos (January 17, 2024), **SparkyLinux 2024.01 uses the Linux kernel 6.6.11 as a powerful base** to provide better hardware support, networking improvements, and more.

Then there are the **installer updates;** where Calamares 3.3.1 is now used for the conventional variants of SparkyLinux. Similarly, the Sparky CLI installer sees a few tweaks such as a progress output being shown when files are being copied, and the removal of installation on XFS file system.
