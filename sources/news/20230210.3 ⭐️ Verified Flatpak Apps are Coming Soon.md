Verified Flatpak Apps are Coming Soon
======

Flatpak apps now have a verified badge icon, only on the beta portal for now.

![Verified Flatpak Apps are Coming Soon][1]

This was already in the works since late last year when a GitHub [merge request][2] added initial support for a status verification icon on the Flathub site.

And now, the verified apps can be seen on Flathub's beta platform.

**What is it?:** It is a work-in-progress verification system for Flatpak apps on the Flathub platform that will **facilitate showing a blue check mark** beside the name of an app after it has been verified.

As you can see, currently, over 70 apps, have been added to the [verified list on the beta platform][4]. We expect this number to increase when this is made available for general use.

**How to get verified?:** The developers have to log in to [beta.flathub.org][6] with the GitHub or GitLab account linked to their app, then head to your **Developer Profile.**

You need to **select the app** to verify (if there are multiple) and then follow the instructions under "**Developer Settings**".

Furthermore, **there are concerns** over which apps should be allowed to gain verified status.

For instance, a Reddit user [raised concerns][7] when they noticed an unofficial client for WhatsApp had gained verified status.

Sure, it means that the app developer is the one maintaining/publishing the Flatpak. But **it is still a third-party app and not something from WhatsApp**.

You get the point.

> 📝 The app has since been removed from the verified list.

This can cause plenty of issues, especially related to copyright ones, where the [IP][8] holder could quickly **object to their property** being repackaged and used as an official-looking copy.

Let's see how Flathub handles situations like this when this feature is rolled out fully.

**When can you expect it?:** Sometime this year would be my best guess, as there has not been an official announcement giving a specified date.

Its implementation on Flathub's beta channel is a good sign.
