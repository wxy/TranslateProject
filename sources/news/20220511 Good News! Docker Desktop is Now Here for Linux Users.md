Good News! Docker Desktop is Now Here for Linux Users
======
You can now seamlessly create containers using Docker Desktop on Linux. It is available for Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora, with experimental support for Arch Linux.

![docker][1]

Docker Desktop is the easiest way to containerize applications. You do not need to think about setting up an environment on the platform of your choice to get started.

You just need to install the Docker Desktop, and you will be good to go. The Docker Desktop application comes with container tools like Kubernetes, Docker Compose, BuildKit, and vulnerability scanning.

While it was available for Windows and macOS, it did not support the Linux platform. So, Linux users were restricted to the docker engine to create/test their docker containers.

Finally, anyone who wants to make things convenient using Docker on Linux can do it using Docker Desktop.

### Docker Desktop for Linux is Here

[Docker Desktop][2] for Linux was one of the most requested things on their public roadmap for future development/improvements.

With Docker Desktop on Linux, you finally get to experience a cross-platform Docker experience without much hassle.

To mention some highlights, as a developer on Linux desktop, you can now:

* Access new features using Docker Extensions
* Seamlessly integrate with Kubernetes
* Easily manage and organize volume, containers, and images.

### Installing Docker Desktop on Linux

It is worth noting that it may not be super easy to install Docker Desktop for now, but it isn’t overly complicated either.

The Docker team plans to improve the installation and update process as soon as possible.

As of now, you get deb and rpm packages officially supported for Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora. The Docker Desktop package for Arch Linux is a work in progress, but it is available to test.

It also needs you to install the GNOME terminal if you are on a non-GNOME desktop environment.

The overall system requirements for Docker Desktop on Linux include:

* 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 21.10, Fedora 35, Fedora 36, or Debian 11.
* KVM virtualization support
* QEMU 5.2 or newer
* Systemd init system
* GNOME or KDE desktop environment
* 4 GB of RAM

For installation, you can follow the [official instructions][3] in the documentation.
