Ubuntu 21.10 Has Reached End-of-Life, Upgrade Now!
======
Ubuntu 21.10 has reached end-of-life on 14th of July. Backup your files before starting an upgrade!

![ubuntu 22 10][1]

While [Ubuntu 21.10][2]was the only way to experience GNOME 40 back then, it brought a newer kernel and high-quality Bluetooth codecs.

Unfortunately, it reached end-of-life on the **14th of July**, meaning you will no longer receive any updates for it.

So it’s time to upgrade!

I know, for some, it’s not much time since you switched to Ubuntu 21.10, but it’s not an LTS release. So, it had only nine months of support after its release.

If you want to know about the release and update cycles, you can check out our [guide on end-of-life][3].

When writing this article, there’s only one option available: **[Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.][4]**

[Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is different from Ubuntu 20.04][5] in several ways and offers a bunch of new features.

### Upgrading to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Unless you are going to use your system completely offline, you must upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 as it would protect you against the latest security vulnerabilities.

In fact, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is the [most secure release yet][6].

There are plenty of other reasons why you should upgrade, including user experience improvements, better performance, and newer hardware support.

Not to forget, [Long-Term Support Release][7] edition gives you up to 5 years of software updates, and 10 years of maintenance updates, ensuring the stability you need for production.

Whether you use your system/server for personal or commercial use.

**Here’s how to upgrade:**

You can look for **“Software Updater**” from the app menu and click on it to proceed with the latest upgrade.

If you prefer the terminal, type in the command to start the update manager:

```
update-manager -c
```

In either case, type in the following from the terminal:

```
sudo do-release-upgrade
```

You will be informed that your system is out of support and will be upgraded to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Just click on the upgrade button, and the update manager will take care of it.

### Ubuntu 22.04 Upgrade and Beyond

As always, there are plenty of alternatives to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, including [official Ubuntu flavors][8]. And, if you want something different in Ubuntu space, I highly recommend [Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS.][9]

With the upgrade, you should enjoy the new GNOME 42 experience, a newer kernel, and a better user experience compared to 21.10 and bundled with [new features.][10]

Sure, you are not going to be disappointed!
