FreeBSD 12.4 is out with 100+ improvements and fixes
======

![][1]

**FreeBSD 12.4 was released a few days back with several updates and improvements. Here’s a release roundup.**

FreeBSD is a UNIX-like operating system based on [U.C. Berkley’s BSD-Lite version][2]. It is primarily used for core infra systems, routers, networking devices, and possibly running in millions of devices. FreeBSD bundles thousands of packages from desktop apps to core modules, making it easier to build your system running this awesome operating system.

### FreeBSD 12.4 Release: Key updates

FreeBSD 12.4 is the 5th release of the current 12 stable series and coming up after a year’s package updates, improvements and bug fixes.

Key changes in the release include the OpenSSL version being updated to 1.1.1q, whereas OpenSSH is bumped up to 9.1p1. The LLVM toolchain suite was also upgraded to 13.0.0. Other key version upgrades include `ena` kernel driver 2.6.1, `file` 5.43, `libarchieve` 3.6.0 and `dma` 2022-01-27.

Furthermore, this release now allows multiple cores to process traffic to improve performance by `if_repair` driver. Also, the `tcpdump` command now allows users to set several rules which will be exposed as part of the `pflog` header.

On top of that, the `telnetd` daemon is deprecated in this version which should be noted for network professionals.

The total number of changes and fixes exceeds 100+, which you can read in detail in the [change log][4].
