Adding a Pop of Color to GNOME: Accent Colors Are on the Way
======

GNOME users, were you waiting for this moment? Get ready to choose your color!

Support for accent colors has been on Ubuntu since [22.04 LTS][2], and people loved it. Sadly, GNOME never had that kind of support — yet.

Thanks to an **effort underway to introduce accent color support in GNOME,** that is changing.

**What is it?:** Recently, a proposal was sent out with a [merge request][3] to add support for accent colors to GNOME, the development of which is being led by [Alexander Mikhaylenko][4].

In its current state, it's in a **very work-in-progress condition** with a lot of work pending as well as a few issues here and there which should be handled before the final release.

When looking at the code, it is clear that **initially support for 10 accent colors will be offered**, with the possibility of more options after release.

**Wondering how it might look?**

Well, in a [discussion][5] on Mastodon, a few mockups made by Alexander were shared by a GNOME foundation member, [Jamie][6], that depicts two distinct colorways.

One is a green one.

The other is blue.

I must say these look nice! 😃 Want some Fedora love on your non-Fedora distro? Turn it to blue and something else? Choices, choices!

> 📝 Do keep in mind that whatever you see above is subject to change before final release.

**When to expect?:** When asked by another user in the above-mentioned discussion, Alexander mentioned that we can **expect accent color support to arrive with GNOME 45**.

Seeing that GNOME 44 was recently released, we will have to wait a bit before we can actually see this being implemented.

But, it is good to know that there is a possibility of it happening soon after!

I do like that GNOME is finally getting support for accent colors, and I hope the wait is worth it.

_💬 If you ask me, I would love having the Green accent color on my GNOME system. What about you?_
