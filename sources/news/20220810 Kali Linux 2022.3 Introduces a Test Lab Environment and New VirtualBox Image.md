======

Kali Linux is back with exciting additions for its third upgrade in 2022.

As usual, you can expect new tools and refinements across the board. In addition, there are a few key highlights, including a **new test lab environment** and a **VirtualBox image**.

Here, let me give you more details on the release.

### Kali Linux 2022.3: What’s New?

Kali Linux 2022.3 release marks the start of their **new Discord server**, allowing the community to get together and chat all about Kali Linux.

Along with the community getting a Discord server, things that should grab your attention for the upgrade include:

  * **A new test lab environment for easy testing.**
  * **Opening kali-tools repository for community submissions.**
  * **New releases in NetHunter store.**
  * **A new VirtualBox image format.**
  * **Bunch of new tools.**



### Test Lab Environment

Kali Linux is tailored for security researchers to test and learn. But, to enhance the experience and make it effortless for anyone to build a test lab, Kali Linux now adds easy-to-install packages like [DVWA][1], and [Juice Shop][2].

The developers also mention that there will be more packages available in the near future.

### New Tools

The new upgrade includes five interesting tools, they are:

  * **BruteShark** (Network Analysis Tool)

### Enhanced VirtualBox Support

While Kali Linux was already available for VMware and VirtualBox, we now have a new image format for VirtualBox users.

You can now download a **VDI** disk image and a **.vbox** metadata file for VirtualBox. It is the native format for VirtualBox images, and faster to download, considering a better compression ratio.

For users looking to be on the latest and greatest, Kali Linux has made **weekly builds of VM images available**, built from its rolling branch.

Additionally, if you need to build your custom VM images, Kali Linux has made some scripts available on [GitLab][3].
