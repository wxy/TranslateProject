Grafana Phlare is a New Scalable Open-Source Database to Enhance Observability
======

Grafana Phlare aims to be a scalable, durable, cheap, and open-source database for continuous profiling data.

[Grafana][2] is a popular open-source data visualization tool that supports various object storage and cloud services.

To improve on what they offer, Grafana has announced a **new open-source database for continuous profiling data** that helps enhance the monitoring of servers (or your application), making life easier for performance engineers and enterprises.

### Open Source Database for Continuous Profiling

> 💡Continuous Profiling is a dynamic method of analyzing key performance metrics of a server, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and more, at any period of time.

Grafana Phlare is a highly scalable database that aims to provide users with a long-term storage solution for continuous profiling data.

The core features involve:

- **Easy to install**
- **Horizontal scalability**
- **High availability**
- **Cheap, durable profile storage**
- **Natively multi-tenant (enabling independent teams to share the same database)**

You would say that: there are already a few similar open-source projects. And you wouldn't be wrong.

But, the team behind Phlare mentioned that those tools were not reliable or scalable enough to meet Grafana Labs' continuous profiling needs.

> So we decided to get to work creating a database for continuous profiling telemetry, based on the design principles that have made our other open source observability backends, Loki, Tempo, and Mimir, so successful: horizontally scalable architecture and use of object storage.- Cyril Tovena, Software Engineer at Grafana

As for the technical tidbits of Phlare, it uses object storage to store profiling data and supports various object storage services such as[Amazon S3][4], [Google Cloud Storage][5], [OpenStack Swift][6], and more.

Also, Cyril mentions that Grafana Phlare is incredibly easy to install:

> It’s easy to install with just one binary and no additional dependencies, just like [Prometheus][7].

**Furthermore**, it can natively integrate with Grafana to show users a detailed view of the whole stack and includes various observability signals such as metrics, logs, and traces.

To complement Phlare, the team also added a new Flame graph panel to better visualize system resources data via various data sources.

**As a bonus**, Grafana also announced a data source plugin for another open-source continuous profiler called '[Parca][10]'.

### 👨‍💻 Try Grafana Phlare

Grafana Phlare is made available as a single binary and can be procured from the official [GitHub repository][11].

You may want to review its [official documentation][12] to learn more about it.
