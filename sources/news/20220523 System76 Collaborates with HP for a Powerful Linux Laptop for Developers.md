System76 already makes Linux laptops. So, what is this all about?

Well, this time, it will be a Linux laptop by HP, powered by Pop!_OS, i.e., the Ubuntu-based Linux distribution by System76.

*Carl Richell* (System76’s Founder) made the announcement through his Twitter handle, with a link to the website that provides additional information on this.

### HP Dev One: A Linux Laptop Built for Developers

System76 laptops are highly praised for their out-of-the-box hardware compatibility with Pop!_OS. A

More of the reason Pop!_OS sits nicely with laptops without many hiccups.

Pop!_OS constantly comes up with updates and feature additions to improve the workflow and make the best out of the available hardware for Linux.

Now, teaming up with HP sounds like a great idea to step up the notch.

So, the idea of a partnership between Pop!_OS and HP is exciting!

With HP, the availability/warranty of the laptop sounds good on paper compared to System76 laptops in the region where it is not available.

### AMD-Powered Laptop to Help You Code Better

HP Dev One seems to start featuring the essentials for developers to multitask, and get things done quickly.

The laptop uses an **8-core AMD Ryzen 7 PRO processor** coupled with **16 GB RAM** (DDR4 @ 3200 MHz) for starters.

You can expect a 14-inch full-HD anti-glare display powered by AMD’s Radeon Graphics.

With HP Dev One, Carl Richell mentions that the laptop will receive **firmware updates** via the [LVFS][5] (Linux Vendor Firmware Service).

The pricing for the laptop has been mentioned to start at **$1099** for the mentioned specifications.

The website only says that it is coming soon. So, we do not have an official launch date as of now.

For a commercial manufacturer like HP, the pricing for the laptop does not sound mind-blowing, but could be a fair deal.

*What do you think about the pricing for the HP laptop tailored for developers using Linux? Does the price tag sound good? What are your expectations from the laptop?*
