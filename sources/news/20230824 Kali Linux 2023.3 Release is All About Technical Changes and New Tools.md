Kali Linux 2023.3 Release is All About Technical Changes and New Tools
======
Kali Linux's latest release deals with under-the-hood changes and some
new tools.
Kali Linux is the go-to option for pen testers worldwide, being a [penetration-testing-focused][1] distro, it offers a sizeable library of tools that cover a variety of use cases.

Just a [few months prior][2], we had covered the 2023.2 release of Kali Linux that offered some neat improvements.

And now, we have yet another release in the form of **Kali Linux 2023.3** that **focuses more on the back-end**.

Let's dive in and see what's on offer.

## 🆕 Kali Linux 2023.3: What's New?

![][3]

Powered by [Linux Kernel 6.3][4], Kali Linux 2023.3 is a very focused release that touches on a few key things. Some highlights include:

  * **Refreshed Packaging Tools**
  * **Improved Internal Infrastructure**
  * **New Networking Tools**



### Refreshed Packaging Tools

Kali Linux has expanded on their publicly available [home-made scripts][5] by adding new functionality, various quality-of-life improvements, and new scripts.

The packaging tools include:

  * [Britney2][6]
  * [Build-Logs][7]
  * [Package Tracker][8]
  * [AutoPkgTest][9]
  * And more.



### Improved Internal Infrastructure

Due to the recent release of Debian 12, the developers of Kali Linux were able to re-work, re-design, and re-architecture their infrastructure.

It is a massive undertaking that has **allowed them to simplify their software stack** , by using one piece of software for important elements of how they handle Kali Linux.

So, **Debian 12 as its base** , **[Cloudflare][10]** as CDN/WAF, **Web server service -[Nginx][11]**, and **for Infrastructure as Code, it is[Ansible][12].**

Further adjustments on the way with upcoming updates.
