Ubuntu 23.10: The Big Release is Here!
======
Ubuntu 23.10 'Mantic Minotaur' is now here with GNOME 45 and other
fantastic improvements.
It is that time of the year again, when we get to see a new Ubuntu release!

This time it's **Ubuntu 23.10** , which is not a [Long-Term support][1] (LTS) version, and is code-named as ' **Mantic Minotaur** '.

Such releases are geared more towards users who want the latest and greatest that Ubuntu has to offer.

For users who want to stick with one version for a long time, we suggest LTS releases such as [Ubuntu 20.04][2] and [Ubuntu 22.04][3].

Anyway, let's dig into this release and check out its highlights.

💡

Ubuntu 23.10 will be **supported for nine months** until July 2024.

## ⭐ Ubuntu 23.10: What's New?

![][4]

Even though this is a non-LTS release, **Ubuntu 23.10 packs in loads of interesting features and improvements**.

Some key highlights include:

  * **Installer Upgrades**
  * **Restricted unprivileged user namespaces**
  * **GNOME 45**
  * **New Wallpapers**
  * **Flutter-based App Store**
  * **Linux Kernel 6.5**



### Installer Upgrades

![][5]

For starters, the installer for Ubuntu 23.10 features **experimental support for two major features** :

One is the **[TPM-backed full-disk encryption][6]** (FDE) **,** that sees a completely revamped mechanism being implemented for encrypting disks. It works in tandem with the TPM chip on your motherboard.

The other is the long-awaited return of [**ZFS support**][7] to the installer, after it was dropped in the [Ubuntu 23.04][8] release.

📋

Broader hardware support for TPM-backed FDE is set to arrive with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

### Restricted unprivileged user namespaces

![][9]

Ubuntu 23.10 debuts a new security feature. It restricts the kernel feature ' _unprivileged user namespaces_ ', which is useful to let applications create a more secure sandbox.

If it is useful, why restrict it? Well, the kernel feature lets attackers exploit a system.

So, to eliminate the risk associated with the feature, [AppArmor][10] will be used to selectively allow/disallow unprivileged user namespaces.

This security feature will not be enabled by default but as an opt-in via command line. Canonical will collect user feedback and then may decide to push it as the default with an update.

### GNOME 45

![][11]

Ubuntu 23.10 features the recently released [**GNOME 45**][12] desktop environment that features a **tweaked system settings app** , **updated core apps** with the **inclusion of two new apps** called ' **[Loupe][13]** ' and ' **[Snapshot][14]** '.

Even the new [**pill-shaped workspace indicator**][15] has made a debut with this release, though not everyone might be on board with that.

### New Wallpapers

![][17]

As is tradition, the Ubuntu 23.10 release also **features new wallpapers** themed according to its code-name. All of them look quite nice, and these were selected from the Mantic Minotaur [wallpaper competition][18] that was held a few months prior.

You can check the [official blog][19] to know more about these extremely cool wallpapers.

📋

Personally, I love the 'Bodacious Bovine' Light/Dark ones. 😄

### Flutter-based App Store

![][20]

Canonical's push for Flutter-basing the various elements of Ubuntu has received a boost thanks to the implementation of **a new[Flutter-based store][21] on Ubuntu 23.10**. It features **an updated layout** , **a new application view** , and **better search functionality**.

You can find both Snap and Deb packages with it.

![][22]

### Linux Kernel 6.5

![][23]

And finally, we have the magic sauce that makes it all happen. **Ubuntu 23.10 features the relatively new[Linux kernel 6.5][24]**.

This allows Ubuntu to take advantage of the newer support such as **Wi-Fi 7** , **USB4** , **out-of-the-box support for AMD FreeSync video** , **overclocking support for AMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards** and more.

### 🛠️ Other Changes

Other than the highlights, here are some other changes worth noting:

  * **Support for the recently released[Raspberry Pi 5][25], and [HiFive Pro P550][26].**
  * **[Enhanced security][27] for PPAs**
  * **Better support for Rust.**
  * **Inclusion of[Shotwell 0.32][28].**
  * **Introduction of a vastly improved tiling assistant.**
