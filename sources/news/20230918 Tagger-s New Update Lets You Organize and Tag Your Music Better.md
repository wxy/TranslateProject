Tagger's New Update Lets You Organize and Tag Your Music Better
======
Using Tagger to tag your music? Now, it comes with new feature additions
and fixes.
Tagger has received a new release with plenty of useful improvements!

For those not aware, Tagger is **an open-source[tag editor app][1]** that focuses on popular music file types such as MP3, OGG, FLAC, WAV, and more.

It can be used to **add important metadata to a music file** , such as the album art, artist/publisher info, year of release, and even custom properties.

Let's see what this new release of Tagger has to offer.

## 🆕 Tagger V2023.9.1: What's New?

Written in the C# programming language, Tagger's **been around since late-2021** , and has been receiving improvements regularly.

With this release, **Tagger V2023.9.1** has added several refinements.

To start with, it includes **updated translations,** made possible thanks to the users on [Weblate][3].

Then there's the **newly added ability** to **open, manage, and create playlists** within Tagger. This is meant to make it easier to handle many music files together, resulting in the “Music Folder” now being called “ **Music Library** ”.

Next, **synchronized lyric timestamps are now shown in the “mm:ss.xx” format** , following the [LRC][4] specifications, and both “ **hh:mm:ss** ” and “ **mm:ss.xx** ” formats can be specified, allowing Tagger to convert them.

Furthermore, Tagger now **displays headers in the music files list** when sorting, for a more organized view of the files, the **main window size is not lost on app restart** , and **LRC files now get imported correctly**.

For more technical details, you may refer to its [release notes][5].

## 📥 Download Tagger V2023.9.1

You can grab the latest release of Tagger by opting for one of the available packages, as:

  * **[Snap][6]**
  * **[Flatpak][7]**
  * **[AUR Package][8]**



[Tagger (Flathub)][7]

For Ubuntu, you can also run the following command to get it installed:

💡

While we were talking about an application to add metadata, there's also [Metadata Cleaner][9]. It allows you to clean metadata off most popular file types, the entire opposite of Tagger.
