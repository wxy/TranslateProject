Linux Mint to Maintain Timeshift Backup Tool as an XApp
======
Linux Mint takes over the development of ‘Timeshift’ backup/restore tool. You can now find it in its new GitHub repository.

![linux mint][1]

Timeshift is arguably the [best tool to back up and restore the Linux system][2].

Linux Mint also utilizes the tool to let users easily take snapshots before updates, and ensure hassle-free operation.

Of course, that’s not the only thing that makes [Linux Mint potentially better than Ubuntu][3].

Unfortunately, the developer ([Tony George][4]) behind Timeshift can no longer maintain the project. The developer plans to focus on other projects instead.

The Linux Mint team reached out to the developer to help the project in any capacity. And, they finalized to take over the development of Timeshift.

So, now, the Linux Mint team will be responsible for new releases/fixes, and any development activity associated with Timeshift.

### Adopting Timeshift as an XApp

![][5]

Linux Mint tends to maintain certain applications as an “XApp” to make sure that they work on various desktop environments and are not dependent on a particular desktop.

Considering that they plan to adopt Timeshift as an XApp, you can expect the tool to continue offering the current look/functionality for a long time, irrespective of your desktop environment.

Unlike some GNOME apps, which are usually turning into GNOME-only applications for the best experience.

Timeshift is an essential backup/restore tool. So, Linux Mint taking over the development and maintaining it as an XApp sounds perfect!

The translations for Timeshift are now done on [Launchpad][6], if you are curious.

The [new GitHub repository][7] (forked by Linux Mint) can give you more details about the application and its latest development activity.

You can also check out the official announcement for this in the [recent monthly blog post][8].

### Wrapping Up

With Linux Mint as the maintainer of Timeshift, we could hope for more feature additions and improvements in the near future.
