Good News! Native Translation Finally Arrives With Firefox 118😍
======
Firefox 118 makes it easy for users to translate webpages.
In recent times, Mozilla seems to be busy improving Firefox in whatever way possible. Take, for instance, [better support][1] for Google's web services, or the previous [Firefox 117 release][2].

And now we have yet another release in the form of the Firefox 118 release, that **finally introduces privacy-focused translations natively** , doing away with the need for workarounds.

Let's dive in and see what this release has to offer.

## 🆕 Firefox 118: What's New?

![][3]

Firefox 118, like previous releases, has a lot to offer. Some key highlights include:

  * **Native In-Browser Translations**
  * **Improvements for Google Meet**
  * **Important Security Fixes**



We will first focus on the translation feature, then the rest.

### Native In-Browser Translations

Well, after some time of testing, [Firefox][5] finally has **native support for in-browser translations**. We checked this out in the [Firefox 117 release][2], but it was not available by default.

Now, it's just a few clicks away, as shown in the video above. You just have to go into the hamburger menu, then click on ' **Translate page** ', then select the translate from and to languages and click on ' **Translate** '.

For switching back to the original language, just click on the translation logo in the address bar, and click on ' **Show original** '.

In my experience, **this feature runs into some issues** when there are multiple languages on the same webpage, and there's no support for translating text from images or videos.

But that figures, as **the translation widget still says 'Beta'** on it. I am certain that the developers will push updates for improving its functionality in the coming months.

### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

As for the rest of the under-the-hood refinements:

  * Video effects and background blur are now available for Firefox users on [Google Meet][7].
  * [Firefox suggest][8] users will now be shown browser add-on suggestions in the address bar. (US Only).
  * The visibility of fonts on websites has been restricted to only system fonts, to stop font fingerprinting in private browsing windows.
  * Web audio in Firefox now makes use of the [FDLIBM][9] math library to improve privacy.
  * Various [security fixes][10].



You can also go through the official [release notes][11] to dive further into some technical bits.

## 📥 Get Mozilla Firefox 118

Firefox 118 is available to download from the [official website][12] as a **.tar.bz2 package** , and as a **Flatpak** from the [Flathub store][13].

In either case, you can also try Firefox's [Snap package][14].
