Armbian 23.11 Release Supports New Boards And Adds New OS Builds
======
A new update to Armbian with better support for new hardware and new
builds.
A first choice for many [single-board computer][1] (SBC) enthusiasts, [Armbian][2] is a [lightweight Linux distribution][3] that gives you a highly extensible user experience that can run on various configurations.

It is **offered in two distinct flavors** , one is based on a minimal Debian base, and the other is based on a lightweight Ubuntu base.

A few days back, **Armbian 23.11** was released with many changes and improvements. Let's take a brief look at the new changes.

### Armbian 23.11 “Topi”: What's New?

Dubbed by the developers as a “ _pretty special_ ” version, Armbian 23.11, code-named “ _Topi_ ” is meant to be **the result of a decade worth of work** that has made Armbian **a popular choice for SBC tinkerers**.

Let's start with the **key highlights** of this release:

For starters, the **Armbian support policy tiers have been tweaked** to reflect better reliability and assistance for boards. The three tiers are:

  * **Standard Support** , where boards will receive full and consistent support.
  * **Staging Support** , this is tailored for boards that are undergoing support validation.
  * **Community Maintained** , these boards depend on the wider community for maintenance.



Under this, **four new boards were added to the Standard Support tier** ; [Khadas VIM1S][5], [Khadas VIM4][6], [Texas Instruments TDA4VM][7], and Xiaomi Pad 5 Pro.

Additionally, support was also added for boards such as the NanoPi [R6S][8]/[R6C][9], [Mekotronics R58X-Pro][10], [Inovato Quadra][11], and [Tanix TX6][12].

On the user-facing side of things, **various fixes were made to the display managers** across all the desktops, inclusion of a mainline kernel for [Rockchip RK3588][13] with **experimental HDMI and EDK2/UEFI support**.

Furthermore, the **edge kernel offering of Armbian** now features [Linux Kernel 6.6][14], and features new Armbian wallpapers. There are also a few bug fixes to **improve hardware support for existing boards** , **fix display output issues** , **handle compilation issues for various kernels** , and more.

You may go through the [official blog][15] to dive into the fine print of this release.

### 📥 Download Armbian 23.11

Armbian 23.11 is available to download from the [official website][16]. The developers have also introduced **two new daily builds** , one with [**Ubuntu Mantic Minotaur**][17] and the other with **Debian Trixie**.

[Armbian 23.11][16]
