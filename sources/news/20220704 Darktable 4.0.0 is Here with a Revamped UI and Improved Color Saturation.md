Darktable 4.0.0 is Here with a Revamped UI and Improved Color Saturation
======
darktable 4.0.0 release is here as a major upgrade with new features, simplified UI, and other enhancements.

![darktable][1]

Recently, the developers unveiled new stable release as an upgrade over its 3.8.x series.

The latest upgrade is about new features, bug fixes, and significant changes.

### darktable 4.0: What’s New?

With darktable 4.0, we have a lot of feature additions and some impactful rework on the user interface.

Let me mention the key highlights here:

**Note:** This is a major upgrade with a new library and configuration, not compatible with the older version. So, you need to take a backup of your work before proceeding.

#### Color and Exposure Mapping

Within the exposure and color calibration modules, you now get the ability to define and save a target color/exposure for the color pickers.

This should help you match source objects in the image and ensure the color consistency of an object across a batch of photos.

#### UI Rework

![darktable][2]

The user interface has undergone a revamp to improve the look/feel. Starting with the default theme being changed to “**Elegant Grey**“.

Overall, padding, margins, color, alignment, and icons, everything has received a makeover. New collapsible sections (channel mixer rgb, exposure, color calibration) have also been added to make the UI cleaner, and more accessible.

You will find numerous subtle changes for a better layout.

#### Performance Changes

Several optimizations have been added to the release while simplifying the user preferences.

You also get to change the performance configuration without requiring to restart darktable.

#### Improved Color Saturation

![darktable][3]

The addition of Filmic v6 (a new color science) helps for more saturated colors, especially in blue skies.

Also, color-grading should be safer considering it can be recovered in the least-destructive way, as mentioned in the announcement post. In addition to that, a new information color space has been designed for artistic saturation changes.

Overall, you should be happy about this release’s refinements to the saturation control.

#### Other Changes

Some other notable changes include:

* A new “guided Laplacian” method has been added to the highlight reconstruction module.
* Global color picker tool improvements
* A new contrast parameter
* A new collection filters module
* Support for EXR 16-bit (half) float export has been added.

You may go through all the technical details in its [official announcement post][4].

### Download darktable 4.0.0

You can get the latest version using the Flatpak package on [Flathub][5]. When writing this, the Snap package wasn’t updated.

In either case, you can also choose to use the tar.xz file available in its [GitHub releases section][6].
