======
MX Linux 23 is the next major upgrade with essential upgrades and
refinements.
MX Linux is a [Debian-based distro][1] that focuses on providing an elegant and efficient desktop experience. Not to forget, MX Linux is also a [systemd-free distro][2].

The last major release was MX Linux 21, which was a [long time ago][3].

Luckily, a new release has been introduced that promises quite a few improvements.

Let's look at all the refinements with MX Linux 23, codenamed **Libretto.**

Based on the latest **[Debian 12 'Bookworm'][5]** , MX Linux 23 features the long-term supported [**Linux Kernel 6.1 LTS**][6] **** as its foundation.

A new application, ****“User Installed Packages”**** is available on both MX-21 and MX-23. The app will make a file containing a list of packages installed by the user on one system. When migrating, you can use this file to install the packages on another system.
