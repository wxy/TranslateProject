GNOME 45 Packs in Exciting Upgrades: Here's What's New
======
The features and improvements that you can expect with GNOME 45. We've
listed them here.
Every major GNOME release is exciting to me.

You can always expect **UI-focused changes** , **feature improvements** , and **updates to the core apps**.

[GNOME 44][1] introduced some interesting abilities like being able to check running background apps, thumbnail view in the file chooser, and more.

The GNOME 45 release is scheduled for **September 20** , but the feature set can already be seen in its beta version. So, let us look at what you can expect with GNOME 45.

### GNOME 45: What's New?

![][2]

The key highlights include:

  * **New core apps**
  * **New privacy hub in system settings**
  * **A new "About" panel in the system settings**
  * **New icon for Calendar app**
  * **UI tweaks to the Nautilus file manager**



I shall categorize all such changes to help you understand better. So, let me get to that now:

#### Improvements to Nautilus

![Nautilus file manager, current design \(left\) and improved design \(right\)][3]

The Nautilus file manager did not receive any UI tweaks last time. But, with GNOME 45, a subtle UI makeover was added where you can see the hamburger menu in the sidebar.

Overall, the left sidebar is more distinguishable from the rest of the window.

You can also expect refinements to its performance and search improvements.

#### System Setting Changes

GNOME has been hard at work since GNOME 43 and 44 to make the system setting options easy to access while uncluttering all that is available.

Here, the " **Privacy** " menu has been revamped, with the options that look organized and accessible.

Next, the "About" section has also been tweaked to display the technical information via " **System Details** " menu, as shown below.

You have to click on the system details to get all the required technical information about the OS and hardware.

In addition, to make things easier for new Linux users:

  * An information popup was added to the Users panel to explain the autologin setting.
  * Descriptions were added to help users understand the options available in the Sharing panel.
  * Improvements to the online accounts panel for refined control.



#### New Core Apps

GNOME 45 replaces the " **Eye of GNOME** " with its new [Loupe Image Viewer][7] app.

Along with this, you can also expect "[Snapshot][9]", which is a new camera app. It will replace "Cheese" and be labelled as "Camera".

Additionally, GNOME Photos has been removed.

#### GNOME Software Upgrades

GNOME Software does not feature any visible UI changes from the get-go, but it gets more valuable.

Some notable changes include:

  * When uninstalling a Flatpak package, you will get a prompt to remove associated app data.
  * An indicator to inform which updates include security fixes.
  * A notification when downloading system updates.



#### Improvements to Core Apps

Various applications have been updated. Starting with **Maps** , there are some subtle changes, like zoom buttons moved from the header bar to an overlay on the map.

![][11]

Rework the reroute sidebar to adapt to touchscreen displays, and everything else in general.

Next, we have the **Weather** app, where the default window size is bigger to accommodate all thermometer widgets. The app also remembers the window size when you re-launch it.

![][12]

Not to forget, the new **Console** app now lets you choose a custom font and has a new preferences window.

![][13]

Overall, the Console gets better with a few other technical improvements.

The **Connections** app can now copy/paste text, images, and files with RDP connections.

Furthermore, the **Calculator** now supports more currencies, including the Nigerian Naira, the Jamaican Dollar, and others.

#### Other Changes

Plenty of other changes may not be noticeable, but it is there. Some of those include:

  * Document Scanner app ported to GTK4
  * New app styling and [adaptive behavior][14] for core apps like Text Editor, Contacts, Files, Web, Calendar, etc
  * Performance improvements
  * Improved information about data collection in the initial setup process



If you want more technical insights into GNOME 45 changes, you can refer to the [release notes][15].

### How Can You Try GNOME 45 Now?

You can experience it on **Fedora 39 pre-release **edition**.** A safer way would be to try **[GNOME OS][16] Nightly** via GNOME Boxes.

**Ubuntu 23.10** daily builds might feature it soon (if not already when you read this).

Of course, the best way is to wait to experience it with Fedora 39 stable release or install it on Arch Linux right after GNOME 45 releases.
