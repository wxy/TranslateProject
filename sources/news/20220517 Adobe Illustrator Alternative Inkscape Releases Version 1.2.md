Adobe Illustrator Alternative Inkscape Releases Version 1.2
======
Inkscape 1.2 is an exciting update with many useful improvements and feature additions. Take it for a spin!

![inkscape][1]

Inkscape is a popular open-source vector graphics program available for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

The latest release focuses on refinements to existing tools and more customization options.

There are also a couple of new additions to the application. Let’s take a look.

Inkscape 1.2 is an exciting update with many useful enhancements. Some of the key changes include:

* Improved gradient editor
* New snapping modes
* Support for Multi-page documents
* Improved export dialog
* Customizable toolbar

Here, I shall highlight the important feature improvements:

#### Multi-Page Document Support

![][4]

You can now create standard/custom-size pages in the same document, and finalize them by saving them as a multi-page PDF.

Not the ability to export, but you can also import a multi-page PDF to make things easy.

### Customize Color Palette

Easily change the size, reconfigure the colors to explore the available color palettes, and select the one you really like.

It should make things quicker when you require working with several color palettes in the user interface.

### New ‘Tiling’ Live Path Effect

If you are working with a large number of objects and want to explore path effects, the new tiling live path effect should be interesting.

You can easily tweak the mirroring mode, adjust the gap, add rows and columns, and get numerous opportunities to get creative.

### Layers and Object Dialog

![][5]

Most of the improvements make the experience more straightforward than it already was. With the new merged layers and object dialog, you can quickly organize/find objects per the layer you’re looking for.

You can even customize the layer and object colors to differentiate them.

### Export Dialog

![][6]

The export dialog now provides you options to choose a simple/batch export along with the ability to pick a file format and DPI settings.

### Other Improvements

In addition to the key highlights, some of the significant changes include:

* Two new modes of on-canvas snapping help align objects.
* You can choose the gradients right within the Fill and Stroke dialog box.
* The ability to edit a marker.
* Improved compatibility with extensions.
* Updated SVG font editor.
* Performance improvements.
* Configurable toolbar.

You can refer to the [Inkscape 1.2 release notes][7] to explore all the technical changes.
