StarFighter: A Linux Laptop with a 4K 10-bit IPS Display is Coming Soon
======
StarFighter is an upcoming Linux laptop by Star Labs. They are finalising the production details while revealing some of the key highlights.

We’ve had numerous Linux-exclusive laptops from manufacturers like Star Labs, TUXEDO, and others.

However, only a handful of them focused on providing a great display.

For instance, [TUXEDO’s Infinitybook Pro 14][2] featured a 3K display. And, it was a nice offering.

Now, it looks like [Star Labs][3] is gearing up with a 15.6-inch 4K display for its upcoming “StarFighter” laptop. They shared initial information on [Twitter][4] mentioning that they are finalizing the production details.

### StarFighter: Here’s What We Know So Far

The laptop will feature a 45W-powered Intel/AMD processor. So, yes, it will have both Intel/AMD variants available.

You will also be getting options for up to 64 GB of memory and 2 TB of storage. It is safe to say that it should be a powerhouse for users who want beefed-up specifications for their Linux laptops.

Of course, the key highlight is the display. It will be sporting a 4K 10-bit matte IPS display.

The company mentions that the display costs more than its StarLite laptop.

But, will this be an attractive offering? Many laptops with high-res displays or OLED panels haven’t worked well with the battery life. Not just Linux laptops.

So, will StartFighter be a competitive contender in the space?

Star Labs mentioned in a tweet that they estimate it for around 8-14 hours depending on the configuration. Of course, it will come down to your usage as well.

The company also clarified that the laptop will be available with coreboot, but it will not be an entirely free software project. Some other points to note include:

* The laptops will feature [LVFS][5] support.
* Intel models will be available with Gen 4 SSDs. AMD variants will be limited to Gen 3.

It could feature elementaryOS 6.1 as the image suggests. However, you should also expect to have Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as an option for the OS.

So, what do you think about StarFighter by Star Labs? Would this be your next laptop when it is available?
