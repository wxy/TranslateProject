Ardour 8.2 Release Adds A Nifty New Feature for Digital Music Creators
======
Ardour's latest update packs in some useful feature additions and
much-needed fixes.
Ardour is a pretty popular open-source choice among Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) users, it has plenty of tools that allow audio professionals to do a range of tasks related to audio.

As **a continuation to the Ardour 8.x series** , the developers have unveiled a new release, **Ardour 8.2**. So, let's dive into this release and see what's on offer.

## 🆕 Ardour 8.2: What's New?

![][2]

The developers say that there is “ _nothing incredibly dramatic_ ” with the update, it is meant to complete pending work for supporting new [Novation][3] devices, a couple of bug fixes and a few improvements.

The **key highlights** include:

  * Dedicated No-strobe Option
  * Support for Novation Devices
  * Note Tupling Feature



### Dedicated No-strobe Option

Introduced as a new user preference setting, this **will disable all flashing and blinking elements** found on Ardour's graphical user interface (GUI). This should be of **huge help for those who are sensitive to such visual stimulation**.

So, things like the clocks, buttons, and meters will stop running, blinking or moving.

### Support for Novation Devices

The Ardour 8.2 release also sees the completion of support for all current-gen (MK3) Novation [Launchpad series][5] of devices. This includes the **Launchpad X** , **Mini** and **Pro**.

The devs followed the user manual for the Launchpad X to implement support, and also made Launchpad Mini behave similar, using a similar layout, without the extra buttons found on the X model.

### Note Tupling Feature

Taking inspiration from the recently launched [Ableton Live 12][6], the developers of Ardour have introduced **a new note tupling feature that lets you split and join notes together** for a more advanced MIDI editing experience.

### 🛠️ Other Changes

As for the rest, here are some other notable changes:

  * Added support for [Solid State Logic UF8][7].
  * Ability to **clear LV2 plugin** scan information.
  * A new **mute button was added** to the recorder view.
  * Improvements to the **marker list display** to be more efficient and orderly.
  * **New Lua scripts** for reversing MIDI notes/regions, and sequencing _mixer-scenes_ using markers.



You may also go through the official [release notes][8] to know more.
