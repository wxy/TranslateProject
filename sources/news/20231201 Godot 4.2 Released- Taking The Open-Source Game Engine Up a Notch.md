### Godot 4.2: What's New?

There are plenty of new things with the Godot 4.2 release. But, we will focus on the **key highlights** :

  * **Official ARM Support on Linux**
  * **Editor Improvements**
  * **More Version Control Friendly**
  * **Enhanced Tilemaps**
  * **Improvements to Multiplayer/Networking**
  * **Better Navigation System**



#### Official ARM Support on Linux

Even though it was possible to manually build Godot for ARM-based devices on Linux, there was **never an official ARM build for Linux**.

However, that has now changed with the Godot 4.2 release. They have provided both **32-bit and 64-bit versions of Godot for ARM** on their downloads page.

Keep in mind that this is **an experimental undertaking** , so expect bugs and issues.

#### Editor Improvements

![][5]

There have been many improvements on the editor side of Godot.

As illustrated by the screenshot above, the first one is a new addition to the code editor called “ **Code Region** ”. It allows you to **break up scripts into named blocks** , which can then be minimized to lessen clutter.

![][6]

Another new addition to Godot is the **ability to extend each side of box shapes individually within the editor viewport**. Previously, this was only limited to the center point and symmetrical extents.

![][7]

The **project manager also sees an update** , the general project import workflow has been improved alongside a rearrangement of buttons.

#### More Version Control Friendly

Godot 4.2 comes with a fix to an issue where changing scenes or renaming nodes during 'ready' would lead to crashes, various issues related to renaming/moving files were also fixed.

The developers also added:

> Also, some cases of sporadic changing of resource IDs in scenes have been solved ([GH-65011][8]). There is still room for improvement, but this already makes 4.2 way more version control friendly.

#### Enhanced Tilemaps

![][9]

Alongside **major performance optimizations to the tile/tilemap system** of Godot, there is a new feature that allows you to **rotate or flip a tile/tile pattern** while placing them anywhere.

#### Improvements to Multiplayer/Networking

This release also features **improvements for the high-level multiplayer system;** the ' _MultiplayerSynchronizer_ ' node now supports syncing of transform components, sub-resource properties, and other types of indexed data.

There is also **a security fix for a denial-of-service vulnerability** that was previously disclosed with the Godot 4.0.4 RC1 release.

📋

The developers recommend that users upgrade to Godot 4.0.4, 4.1.2, or 4.2 to avoid issues.

#### Better Navigation System

![][10]

Godot 4.2 brings about **navigation mesh baking for 2D** , it can handle physics bodies, mesh instances, plain polygons and more.

Furthermore, **support for multi-threading was added** for 2D and 3D navigation mesh baking for improving performance, and reducing stutters.

#### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

There are plenty of other changes worth noting:

  * Improvements to the [GDExtension][11] system.
  * Support for AMD's [FSR 2.2][12] tech.
  * A **major rework** of the graph-building nodes.
  * **Native file selection** dialog for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
  * It is now possible to **specify a different install folder** for add-ons and assets.
  * **A fix for the Steam Input issue** that caused some gamepad events to be handled twice.
