Zorin OS 17 is Redefining the Visual Experience in a Linux Distro
======
Zorin OS 17 will be an aesthetically pleasing experience. What do you
think?
The next upgrade for one of the [most beautiful Linux distributions][1], Zorin OS, is around the corner.

Before the release, they have revealed what you get with Zorin 17, along with the availability of its **first beta version** (for testers).

Let's get started and see what's in store.

### Zorin OS 17: The Best Bits

![][3]

Set to be a major release, Zorin OS 17 is **a long-term support release** (until June 2027), and a packed one at that, with many new and exciting improvements.

According to the developers, Zorin OS 17 has been designed to be their “ _ **greatest and most refined computing experience ever**_ ”, and that claim seems well-founded.

Let's begin with their “ **Spatial Desktop** ” implementation, for instance. It is **meant to give users better contextual awareness** of what's happening on their desktop.

![][4]

A new ' **Desktop Cube** ' has been added that lets you switch between workspaces in a 3D cube-style view that employs a parallax effect to show you a floaty appearance of the app windows.

![][5]

This has also made way for a new “ **Spatial Window Switcher** ” that replaces the standard flat/2D Alt+Tab and Super+Tab window switching dialogs with a 3D window switcher that looks neat.

These do look nice in my opinion; however, these effects might not be everyone's cup of tea, luckily **these “Spatial Features” are not enabled by default**.

Having said that, it is **a bold move for a Linux distribution to include more things (or effects) that promote visual interactions through such features**. While Zorin OS was already a visually appealing distribution, the new multitasking workflow with the spatial desktop should take it up a notch.

A macOS user or a Windows user, who may not be a fan of a typical Linux distribution user interface, might just consider giving Linux a try with Zorin OS's visual approach.

Sure, it may not be rocket science (or a unique implementation) but I believe it makes a difference to countless users with visual experience as a priority.

Zorin OS is doing all that, while keeping the core benefit " _giving users the control for their experience_ ". I like how they are adding these visual goodies, making the computing experience fun 😄

You will have to manually enable these features from the new “Effects” section under the **Zorin Appearance** settings.

Then there's the **advanced window tiling experience,** one of the most requested features by the community.

![][6]

You can now tile windows to use quarter screen corner tiling, and even use keyboard shortcuts to tile windows around the screen. This **will make it easier to multitask effortlessly**.

Even the **Software Store has been revamped** to be faster, and features a new design with an updated homepage that lists out applications in a very intuitive manner. The **app details page has also been improved** to show bigger screenshots, and new information.

![][7]

Similarly, **a new quick settings menu** has been introduced that gives you handy access to important settings, and also **allows you to tweak your system's performance** with the new power modes option (performance/balanced). The power modes should be helpful for laptop users.

![][8]

The devs also showcased **a new screenshot and screen recording** tool that will feel familiar if you have used the native one on GNOME.

They also mentioned **two new desktop layouts** , one is a **ChromeOS-like** layout, the other is a **GNOME 2-like** layout.

These layouts will be available upon the release of Zorin OS 17 Pro.

**So, wrapping up.**

It is nice to see what Zorin OS is trying to achieve, **a user experience like this is usually unseen on Linux distros**. This should act as a way for Zorin to stand out, and **may even encourage more Windows and macOS users to try Linux**.

For more details of the upcoming Zorin OS 17 release, you can refer to the [official blog][10].

Before you go, **would you be interested in an early sneak peek?**
