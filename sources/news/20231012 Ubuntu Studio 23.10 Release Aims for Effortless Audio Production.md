One such release is the Ubuntu Studio 23.10, introducing some useful updates and improvements.

Let's take a look at it.

💡

Ubuntu Studio 23.10 will be supported for **nine** months until **July 2024**.

## 🆕 Ubuntu Studio 23.04: What's New?

![][1]

For those who are not familiar, [Ubuntu Studio][2] is an official [Ubuntu flavor][3] tailored towards **content creators**.

It comes pre-installed with many applications for various purposes, such as audio/video production, photography, streaming, graphics design and more.

This release of Ubuntu Studio is based on the Ubuntu 23.10 release, with some key improvements:

  * **KDE Plasma Improvements**
  * **New Wallpaper**
  * **Updated Application Suite**
  * **Linux Kernel 6.5**
  * **Audio configuration utility with the installer**



### KDE Plasma Improvements

Ubuntu Studio 23.10 features the latest **KDE Plasma 5.27.8** desktop environment that comes with new translations, misc fixes, and three key bug fixes:

  * Soft hyphens in keywords have been removed from the search bar in system settings.
  * Powerdevil doesn't automatically suspend by default when running in a virtual machine.
  * KRunner's debut is faster on X11.



You can go through the [release notes][5] to know more about the technical changes.

### Ubuntu Studio Audio Configuration

The Ubuntu Studio installer now includes a wizard-like audio configuration utility that makes it convenient to set up system-wide audio settings.

You can tweak the audio latency and sample rate as per your requirements.

This utility should be helpful for creators who use Ubuntu Studio for audio production.

### New Wallpaper

![][8]

A new wallpaper called ' **Ubuntu Studio Mantic Minotaur** ' has been introduced with this Ubuntu Studio release that takes pointers from the default wallpaper for Ubuntu 23.10 'Mantic Minotaur'.

I like the way it looks, with a dark appearance to it 🤓

### Updated Application Suite

All of this is powered by **Linux kernel 6.5** , allowing Ubuntu Studio 23.10 to take advantage of things such as **initial support for USB4/Wi-Fi 7** , **various optimizations for AMD stuff** , and more.
