There are a lot of terminal apps out there that offer a range of functionalities.

So, what's unique about Tabby?

Tabby is a cross-platform customizable terminal app with SSH integration. It is a terminal emulator that does not try to be a new shell or Cygwin replacement.

Let's take a look at what Tabby aims to be.

### ⭐ An Impressive Customizable Terminal App

Formerly known as 'Terminus', [Tabby][3] is a highly customizable cross-platform open-source terminal emulator.

It can connect to SSH servers using its integrated connection manager and offers various customization options in terms of appearance and other functionalities. It also supports plugins; these can be added from the settings menu to add more functionality to the app.

If you have been a user of PowerShell ISE, PuTTY, or the mac terminal, Tabby will suit you as a perfect replacement.

It is available for Linux, Windows, and macOS. You can also run Tabby as a portable app for Windows.

They also offer an experimental web app, if you are a fan of it, feel free to try it out.

An **integrated SSH client, font ligature, Unicode support, and configurable shortcuts** make Tabby worth trying.
