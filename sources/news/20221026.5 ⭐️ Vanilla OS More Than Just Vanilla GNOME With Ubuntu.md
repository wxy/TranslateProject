Vanilla OS: More Than Just Vanilla GNOME With Ubuntu
======

Vanilla OS is Ubuntu on stock GNOME with on-demand immutability and package selection freedom. Sounds fun? Read more here.

![Vanilla OS: More Than Just Vanilla GNOME With Ubuntu][1]

That was precisely my thought when I first came across Vanilla OS.

When**Mirko Brombin**, the creator of [Bottles][2], announced it on Twitter, that had me interested in it 😎

I joined their Discord channel and hopped in to become a tester. While I did not point out anything new that other testers already did, keeping an eye on the project development is fun.

Back to the vital question: **What is Vanilla OS?**

**Vanilla OS aims to offer a clean vanilla GNOME experience with on-demand immutability.**

Sounds interesting? Let me tell you a few details about it while I give its first open beta build a try.

> 💡Vanilla OS plans to have a stable release in November. It will follow Ubuntu point releases. So, you can expect **two releases per year**. For example, you can upgrade from Ubuntu 22.04 to Ubuntu 22.10 and further. You should not replace it as a daily driver unless you know what you are doing.

### Vanilla OS: Yet Another Ubuntu-based Distro?

**Yes and no.**

For starters, I see the following unique reasons to give it a try:

- To get a **stock GNOME experience** on top of Ubuntu. (Fedora is an excellent option too, but not for everyone!)
- **Allows you to choose and enable Flatpak/Snap/AppImage** with its first-time setup after installation.
- **On-demand immutability**, meaning you can make the system read-only to prevent critical changes from third-party applications and updates.
- **A new package manager** (apx) allows you to install packages inside a managed container by default.

The first-time setup process is a breeze to experience.

> ℹ️Currently, it uses the Calamares installer. They intend to replace it with Jade, used in **Crystal Linux**.

The more distributions do things like this; I believe more users would be happy to get on board with Linux.

Vanilla OS Package Manager Selection

Of course, distributions like Ubuntu MATE and Pop!_OS have already put in great efforts, and Vanilla OS also adds some improvement to the table.

It looks like a pretty experience! 😊

Once you finish the first-time setup,  you have nothing else to worry about. You get the usual GNOME desktop with nice wallpapers out of the box by **Patrik Kramolis.**

Next, I tried checking the on-demand immutability, which you can see and tweak using the following commands:

![vanilla OS terminal][8]

You can explore more about the utility (almost) that makes this possible on [GitHub][9].

Next, coming to the new package manager, I like the concept of distrobox under the hood, making this possible with apx.

The Distrobox creator **Luca di Maio** is also involved in developing Vanilla OS.

However, when installing a package with apx, you need to initialize the container using the command:

```
apx init
```

If it had done it automatically, I would call it intuitive.

Of course, I'm not aware of the technical limitations. But, for the user end, that would feel seamless!

Overall, a package manager that installs applications utilizing a container, getting the ability to choose your package managers, on-demand immutability, and vanilla GNOME make it seem like a good deal to keep an eye on.

### The Road Ahead: First Impressions

I can see it as my daily driver once it hits the stable release.

**The reason is**: I always like the stock GNOME experience, and I do not have to deal with Fedora's regular upgrades.

Of course, once I get to use the stable release, I can give you a verdict on the entire user experience.

Until then, I'd say it is a project that I believe a lot of users will appreciate 👏

You can download the ISO by joining its Discord channel for now. The ISO is not yet publicly available to all. Take a look at its [documentation][11] if you are curious.

However, as per the roadmap, they plan to have a release candidate soon enough.
