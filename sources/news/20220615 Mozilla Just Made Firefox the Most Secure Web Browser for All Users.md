Mozilla Just Made Firefox the Most Secure Web Browser for All Users
======
Mozilla finally enabled a privacy protection feature that potentially makes it the safest web browser at the time. Do you think so?

![mozilla firefox][1]

Mozilla Firefox is one of the most secure open-source web browsers available.

Undoubtedly, you get the freedom to customize it to harden security, which is why Tor Browser utilizes Firefox at its core.

And, also one of the [reasons why I keep coming back to Firefox][2].

Now, Mozilla has finally enabled a new feature for **all desktop users,** making it the most secure browser (or as they claim).

Here, I’m not talking about anything new, but an existing feature in Firefox, i.e., Total Cookie Protection. It was introduced with [Firefox 86][3] last year, but it was not enabled by default for all users.

### Total Cookie Protection for all users

Whether you are using Windows, Mac, or Linux, the Total Cookie Protection is being rolled out to everyone, making it one of its core features enabled by default.

Initially, to use the feature, you had to enable the strict mode (Enhanced Tracking Protection). But, now, you no longer need to do that.

**What is it?**

In case you are curious, Total Cookie Protection isolates every website with its cookies. Cookies are small bits of data sent to your browser by a website.

So, the cookies will not be shared among websites, thereby, preventing cross-site tracking.

Separate cookie jars will be created for each website you visit.

Mozilla’s blog post explains more about it as:

> Any time a website, or [third-party content][5] embedded in a website, deposits a cookie in your browser, that cookie is confined to the cookie jar assigned to *only*that website. No other websites can reach into the cookie jars that don’t belong to them and find out what the other websites’ cookies know about you — giving you freedom from invasive ads and reducing the amount of information companies gather about you.

### So, Is it a big deal?

Even with all the privacy tracking protection and content blockers in place, cross-site tracking is a problem that not everyone is aware of.

Hence, with cross-site cookie interactions, a lot of your personal activities and habits can help a digital tracking company build an online profile of yours.

But, with Mozilla Firefox, enabling the feature by default on top of all other privacy measures by Firefox, ensures that you should get the most private experience.

And, all that without needing to tweak anything, which should make things convenient for any privacy-centric user.

If you are still curious, you can refer to the [official announcement post][6] by Mozilla.
