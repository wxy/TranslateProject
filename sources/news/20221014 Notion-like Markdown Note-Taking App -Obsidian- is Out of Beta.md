Notion-like Markdown Note-Taking App 'Obsidian' is Out of Beta
======
Obsidian 1.0 is all about the redesign and valuable new features.

![Notion-like Markdown Note-Taking App 'Obsidian' is Out of Beta][1]

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking app that can be used to make knowledge graphs while still offering [Notion][2]-like features.

We already had a detailed article on it before the 1.0 update:

[Obsidian is a Notion Alternative for Hardcore Markdown Users for Creating Knowledge Graph of Notes - It’s FOSS][3]

The release of Obsidian 1.0 marks a crucial step in the development of the app for its desktop and mobile experience.

> 💡 Obsidian is not an open-source app, but it is available for Linux users.

Let's take a look at the new features on offer for desktops.

#### Tabs With Tab Stacking

You can now open multiple tabs in Obsidian and use hotkeys to help you multitask throughout a busy day.

An added bonus, even if you quit Obsidian, it will remember which tabs you had opened and your active state in those tabs.

Tabs can also be grouped to form a stack and switched between, resulting in a decluttered workspace.

#### 🛠️ Other Changes

Other changes worth mentioning include:

* Ability to change the zoom level.
* Improved Obsidian sync.

* Fold Commands for folding lines.
