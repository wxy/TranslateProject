Debian 12 "Bookworm" Has Landed
======

Debian's next big release is here. Learn more about it.

![debian 12][1]

While there is no fixed schedule, a new stable Debian upgrade appears every two years or so.

Debian 11 was released in 2021, and now in 2023, we have the next major version bump, i.e., **Debian 12**.

Interestingly, **Debian 12 has been released with about 100 known bugs**, as mentioned in the release notes. So, you might want to explore the release details before upgrading or installing it.

> 💡 If you did not know, every Debian "stable" release is actively maintained and supported for **at least three years.** And it offers a **two-year extended LTS** support as a commercial offering.Debian 12 will be supported until **June 2028**. You have one year to upgrade from Debian 11.

### What's New in Debian 12?

![debian 12][2]

Of course, with a major upgrade, you can expect package updates and obsolete/old software removed.

Similar to what we mentioned in our [Debian 12 feature list][3], the following enhancements are included:

- **Updated Installer**
- **Linux Kernel 6.1**
- **PipeWire by default**
- **New wallpaper**

#### Installer Upgrades

![debian 12 installer][4]

Every distro focuses on improving the installation experience for new users. And it was time Debian stepped up.

The better handling of non-free firmware on Debian 12 is one of the highlights that should improve the onboarding experience.

In addition, there are many under-the-hood improvements including hardware compatibility upgrades.

#### Linux Kernel 6.1

![debian 12 neofetch][5]

Debian 12 features [Linux Kernel 6.1][6], which is an LTS version.

The kernel comes baked in with Rust's experimental support, AMD hardware optimizations, and improved ARM support.

#### Desktop Environment & Software Upgrades

Debian 12 ships with [GNOME 43][7], [KDE Plasma 5.27][8], LXDE 11, LXQt 1.2.0, MATE 1.26, and [XFCE 4.18][9].

The new desktop environment versions should improve the desktop experience along with the essential application updates that include:

- GIMP 2.10.34
- Perl 5.36
- [Vim 9.0][10]
- OpenJDK 17

![debian 12 wallpaper new][11]

Not to forget, you get a new wallpaper with all the magical software updates.

### Other Changes

While you can go through the [release notes][13] or the [announcement post][14] for full technical details and upgrade information, some important highlights include:

- Pipewire audio server by default
- Go-based packages have limited security support.
- Over 9519 packages were removed because they were old/obsolete.
- Debian 12 can now detect Windows 11 in a dual-boot setup.
