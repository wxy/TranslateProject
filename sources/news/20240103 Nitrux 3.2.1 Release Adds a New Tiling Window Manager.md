======
Nitrux's first update for 2024, and it includes useful changes.
Nitrux is one of the many [immutable Linux distributions][1] for those looking for something different, it is also one of the [most beautiful Linux distros][2] around that comes customized out of the box.

Just a few days into 2024, we now have the Nitrux 3.2.1 release that aims to offer many new improvements and features. So, without any further ado, let's dive into this release!

## 🆕 Nitrux 3.2.1: What's New?

![][4]

Code-named “ _ **se**_ ”, which stands for “safer environment”, the Nitrux 3.2.1 release is powered by an enthusiast-grade **Linux kernel 6.6.9-1-liquorix** that improves performance and hardware support.

You will also notice **a new default wallpaper** (as shown above), it is called “ _Aqua_ ”, an abstract wallpaper that features a wavy blue gradient pattern of differently shaded blue tones. It also has a dark version that is **aimed towards reducing eye strain**.

As for the **key highlights** of this release:

  * **Tweaked Calamares Installer**
  * **Updated Application Suite**
  * **User Interface Improvements**



### Tweaked Calamares Installer

![][5]

The **placeholder text and descriptions for all the input fields** in the Calamares installer have been improved so that the user can easily know which field does what. The slideshow shown during install has also been updated to show info from the Nitrux website.

Moreover, a **new checkbox has been added to the password configuration screen** that lets users enable or disable the password strength notification; it is enabled by default. The **devs recommend users keep it enabled** to avoid any potential security risks.

### Updated Application Suite

On the application side of things, Nitrux 3.2.1 comes equipped with many updated apps, some notable ones include:

  * [Firefox 121][6].
  * [OpenRC 0.52.1][7].
  * [AppArmor 4.0 alpha 2][8].
  * AMD Open Source Driver for Vulkan [v-2023.Q3.2][9].



### User Interface Improvements

![Polonium in action on Nitrux 3.2.1][10]

Nitrux 3.2.1 is equipped with the [KDE Plasma 5.27.10][11] desktop environment, with **KDE Frameworks 5.114.0** and **KDE Gear 23.08.4** completing the KDE experience.

The devs have implemented [Polonium][12], a tiling window manager for [KWin][13] that works with Wayland Plasma 5.27 and later. It lets you **resize/move tiled windows with your mouse and keyboard** , you **can also edit the tile sizes** with the integrated KWin GUI.

Even the **NX Desktop command-line utility and _desktop-config_ saw a refactoring of the code**. Now, there is a new help section, the flags to hide/display window tile bar decorations work correctly, a new flag to restart KWin X11, etc. are some highlights.

📋

Polonium is not enabled by default.

The window switcher sees an update too; Now, when you press “ _Alt+Tab_ ”, you will be shown the **Cover Switch instead of Big Icons**. This was a feature many missed after it was dropped in an earlier Plasma release, but it is back now with Nitrux and the newer Plasma release.

![][15]

And to sum things up, there is also **a new customizable full-screen app launcher** called [Plasma Drawer][16] that will feel familiar if you have used NX Menu and KRunner in the past.

If you don't prefer that, then you can use one of the included alternative launchers, [Launchpad Plasma][17] and [Ditto Menu][18].

### 🛠️ Other Changes and Improvements

As for the other changes, here are some worth noting:

  * New system fonts thanks to [Switzer][19] and [CamingoCode][20].
  * IPv6 Privacy Extensions standard is enabled by default in NetworkManager.
  * Implementation of the KDE Wacom tablet [KCModule][21] for better Wacom product support.
