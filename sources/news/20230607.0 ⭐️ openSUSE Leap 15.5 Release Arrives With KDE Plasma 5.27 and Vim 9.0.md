- and More!

You can go through our coverage of the same to dive deeper into the Plasma 5.27 release:

#### OpenH264 Repository

![opensuse 15.5][5]

Yes, you read that right. openSUSE Leap now has the [**OpenH264**][6] repository enabled by default, resulting in **better video encoding and decoding for real-time applications** such as [WebRTC][7].

This was thanks to the contributions made by [Cisco][8] via their open-source program under [Outshift][9].

#### Vim Editor Upgrades

![vim 9][10]

openSUSE Leap 15.5 features the latest **[Vim 9.0][11]** text editor, powered by a new script language.

This has resulted in dramatic performance improvements, with backward compatibility staying intact.

The software suite on openSUSE Leap has also received some major updates. Some notable ones include:

- Fully functional Python 3.11 stack, in parallel to the system Python (python36)
- Improvements to the Kate text editor
