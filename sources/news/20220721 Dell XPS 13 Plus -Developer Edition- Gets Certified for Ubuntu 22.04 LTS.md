![xps 13 dev][1]

Dell XPS is a premium lineup of laptops suitable for professionals and business users.

And it is also one of the most preferred laptops to run Linux. But, if you have always wanted to get a Dell XPS laptop tailored for Ubuntu’s latest and greatest, the **Dell XPS 13 Plus Developer Edition** is for you.

The developer edition for the 13-inch XPS laptop is now certified to work with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

Certified devices are tested for the best experience, ensuring that every laptop function works as expected.

In other words, you can find the premium laptop available pre-installed with [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS][2] and do not have to worry about its out-of-the-box experience. And, if you already have an XPS 13 Plus laptop, you can install Ubuntu 22.04 manually to get the same optimized experience.

The laptop should be an excellent alternative to [TUXEDO Pulse 15][3] and [HP Dev One][4].

### Dell’s Premium Laptop With a Hassle-Free Ubuntu Experience

While we can always install a Linux distribution on any laptop, it may not be a convenient experience all the time.

Ranging from Wi-Fi compatibility issues to fingerprint authentication, anything can go wrong. Unless a device is officially compatible with an operating system, you can only try with chances of failure.

However, Dell is well-known in the Ubuntu space for offering laptops that work completely fine with Ubuntu’s latest releases. Dell’s XPS 13 Plus Developer Edition is its newest offering certified by Canonical for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

You can check out our [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS feature][5] article to explore what you can expect from it.

Dell’s product manager shared some insights on their long-standing association with Canonical:

> “XPS is an innovation portal for Dell – from its application of cutting-edge technology to experimentation of new user interfaces and experiential design,” said Jaewook Woo, Product Manager, Linux Operating System, Dell Technologies. “By bringing the enhanced performance and power management features of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to our most advanced premium laptop, Dell and Canonical reinforce our joint commitment to continue delivering the best computing experience for developers using Ubuntu.”
