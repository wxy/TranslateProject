Surfshark VPN Now Offers a Full-fledged GUI App for Linux
======
Surfshark VPN releases a fully functional GUI app for Linux users with several essential features.

With VPN providers, it is often important to look for Linux support.

Some VPN services only provide you with OpenVPN configuration, and others offer a CLI app.

ProtonVPN, Mullvad, and a handful of [other providers][2] provide a full-fledged GUI app for Linux.

And, [Surfshark VPN][3] (popular for its incredibly cheap deals) is joining the game with a good-looking graphical user interface.

### Surfshark VPN: A Linux App is Always a Good Addition

![The best VPN for Linux is here!][4]

**Note:** Surfshark VPN is not open-source. We cover it here as an option available for Linux.

Previously, with [Surfshark][5] on Linux, users had to utilize the terminal to initiate connections and manage the app.

Overall, it wasn’t all convenient and limited to a few options. So, they finally launched a GUI app to make things straightforward for Linux users.

Even though you should find more features with the GUI app, there are still a few things that you cannot do with the new app. Surfshark mentions that they will be addressing those in the near future.

Some accessible features with the new GUI app include:

* Setting favorite servers.
* Viewing recently used ones.
* Accessing MultiHop and static options.
* Beautiful VPN state transitions and graceful error handling.
* WireGuard support.
* Adblocker.
* Dark mode.

In addition to the essentials, it also supports a system tray icon that many users should find useful.

Abilities like auto-connect and the kill-switch aren’t present at the moment. But, you can expect it in the near future.

### Install Surfshark VPN on Linux

Surfshark officially supports Ubuntu, Debian, and Linux Mint. You can easily install the deb file for these Linux distros from the official website to get started. Refer to the [methods to install deb files][7], if you need help.

If you prefer the terminal, you can also follow some official instructions on its download page to install the package.

In case you haven’t tried Surfshark previously, they offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. So, it should be a hassle-free way to try it out if you’re not sure.
