ONLYOFFICE 7.5 is Now Available!
======
ONLYOFFICE 7.5 release adds much-needed upgrades like a new PDF editor.
The [open-source Microsoft Office alternative][1], ONLYOFFICE, is a popular choice in the FOSS community. It stands out because it provides plenty of useful features in a compact package.

We had taken a look at the [ONLYOFFICE 7.4][2] release earlier this year, that introduced many improvements.

Just a few months later, we've got another release that's got a lot of new stuff in it.

Let's see what the **ONLYOFFICE 7.5** release has to offer.

üìã

You can find the same improvements for both ONLYOFFICE Docs (online), and ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors. The UI might look a bit different for them.

We tested the ONLYOFFICE Docs 7.5 demo provided by the developers before its release.

### ONLYOFFICE 7.5: What's New?

The key highlights of the release include:

  * **PDF Editor**
  * **New Features for Presentation**
  * **Automatic Hyphenation**
  * **Spreadsheet Improvements**
  * **Enhancements for Document Editor**



#### PDF Editor

![][3]

A new PDF editor has debuted with this release that lets you **highlight, underline/strike-through text** , **add annotations** , **fill forms** , and even **draw in a PDF**.

The devs have also mentioned that **collaborative editing of PDF files** will be added in the near-future.

#### New Features for Presentation

![][5]

A new ' **Morph'** transition was added to the Presentation app that allows for the animating of a smooth movement of elements from one slide to the next.

It can be applied to words, objects, and characters. Furthermore, you can now **set names to objects** to easily find them on other slides.

#### Automatic Hyphenation

![][6]

After many requests from users, ONLYOFFICE now **supports automatic hyphenation of text** in the document editor.

This is set to **result in better authoring of documents** , without having to manually hyphenate words at the end of a line.

#### Spreadsheet Improvements

![][7]

It is now possible to **insert page breaks to divide a worksheet** into separate pages for printing purposes.

You can also **add images to headers/footers** to customize the top and bottom margins.

![][8]

Another interesting bit: **a new Trace Precedents/Dependents feature** graphically displays and tracks the relationships between multiple cells and formulas with tracing arrows.

#### Enhancements for Document Editor

![][9]

A new advanced setting was added that enables ' **Smart Paragraph Selection** '. When active, a paragraph symbol is automatically added to any selected paragraph for better handling of the layout of a document.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Other Changes and Improvements

![][10]

Here are some other notable refinements:

  * **Various improvements were made to the 'Content Controls' feature in the document editor.**
  * **When opening CSV files, the last selected settings, delimiter, and encoding are now restored.**
  * **It is now possible to drag/drop rows and columns to move them within a spreadsheet.**
  * **A new 'Hide Equation Toolbar' setting was included for improving the user experience.**
  * **Extended 'Open Recent' section to easily access another document.**



You may also go through the [release notes][11] for the desktop editors to know more about this release.

### Download ONLYOFFICE 7.5

As ONLYOFFICE is **a cross-platform app** , you can head over to the [official website][12] to get it for **Linux** , **Windows** , **Docker** , **AWS Cloud** and more.

[ONLYOFFICE (Desktop)][13]

**For server and business use;** you can head over to its [enterprise download section][12].
