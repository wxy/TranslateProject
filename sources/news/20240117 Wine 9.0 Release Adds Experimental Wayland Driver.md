Wine 9.0 Release Adds Experimental Wayland Driver
======
Wine's new release is getting ready for the future!
Wine is a popular open-source compatibility layer used to [run Windows applications on Linux][1] with ease; something that was a far cry a few years back.

Even [Vaas][2] would agree that Wine is a very neat piece of software that has **taken Linux forward** in a very meaningful way.

Last year, we took a look at the [Wine 8.0 release][3] that aimed to unify all the changes from the 7.x series of releases. But, it is now 2024, and we have yet another Wine release to take a look at.

## 🆕 Wine 9.0: What's New?

Debuting with this Wine release is **an experimental Wayland graphics driver** that brings about things like **High-DPI scaling** , **support for multiple monitors** , **basic window management** , and more.

However, this is not a complete implementation, and naturally is **disabled by default**. You can enable it by running the following command:

```

    wine reg.exe add HKCU\\Software\\Wine\\Drivers /v Graphics /d x11,wayland

```

This comes as no surprise, as **we have been seeing a steady growth in the adoption of Wayland** , and Wine is just among the many to join the club. The coming years will be crucial for [Wayland][5], and I hope it makes good on its promises.

**On the graphics side of things** , Wine now supports up to version _1.3.272_ of the Vulkan spec and the _PostScript_ driver was reimplemented to work using Windows-format spool files and to avoid any direct calls from Unix.

Building on the work done to convert modules into the PE format, now, **on WoW64,** all transitions from Windows to Unix code now go through the _NT syscall interface_.

There is also **support for 32-bit applications on macOS** thanks to the **new WoW64 mode** , which works by making calls to the 64-bit Unix library from the 32-bit PE code.

And finally, we have **improvements to the input device support** with Wine 9.0 that now implements _DirectInput action maps_ to improve compatibility with many old games.

For details of the Wine 9.0 release, you may go through the [changelog][6].

## 📥 Get Wine 9.0

The binary packages for Wine can be found on the [official website][7], where you can find packages for **Ubuntu** , **Debian** , **Fedora** , and **macOS**.

[Wine 9.0][7]

There are some other binary packages maintained by distros such as **SUSE** , **Slackware** and **FreeBSD**. If that doesn't interest you, then you could build from source by visiting its [GitLab repo][8].

### ⚙️ Upgrade from Older Release

If you are running an older release of Wine, then **follow these steps to get the latest release of Ubuntu** , or systems equipped with Ubuntu-based derivatives.

Enable support for 32-bit architecture (if not enabled already) by running the following command:

```

    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386

```

Download the official Wine repo key and add it:

```

    sudo mkdir -pm755 /etc/apt/keyrings
    sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/winehq-archive.key https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key

```

Then run **one** of the following commands to get the WineHQ sources file for your Ubuntu version:

```

    sudo wget -NP /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/mantic/winehq-mantic.sources #Ubuntu 23.10

    sudo wget -NP /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/lunar/winehq-lunar.sources #Ubuntu 23.04

    sudo wget -NP /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/jammy/winehq-jammy.sources #Ubuntu 22.04

    sudo wget -NP /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/focal/winehq-focal.sources #Ubuntu 20.04

```

And finally, to install Wine 9.0, run the following commands (separately):

```

    sudo apt update

    sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable

```

At the time of writing, **the stable branch had the older Wine 8.x release for my system running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**. The development branch had the newer Wine 9.0 release, so I suggest you wait it out a bit before upgrading.
