UbuntuDDE Remix 23.04 is Here!
======
UbuntuDDE Remix 23.04 is here with the latest goodness of the Deepin
Desktop Environment.
We looked at UbuntuDDE Remix [last year][1] when they released a new LTS release. And now, almost a year later, we have **a new non-LTS release** in the form of **UbuntuDDE Remix 23.04** **based on the recently released Ubuntu 23.04 release**.

If you didn't know, Ubuntu DDE Remix is a distro that features [Deepin][2] desktop environment (DDE) on top of Ubuntu to give a unique user experience.

UbuntuDDE is a nice alternative for users who dislike Deepin for its slow servers and other concerns because of its Chinese origin (yet like the desktop experience).

Let's see what they are offering with this release.
