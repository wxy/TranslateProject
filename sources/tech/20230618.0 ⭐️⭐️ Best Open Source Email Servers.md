Best Open Source Email Servers
======

It is convenient to use email services like Gmail, Proton Mail, and Outlook to send and receive emails, no matter what [email client][1] you use.

And, for all of that, you utilize their mail servers for email transactions. So, your emails' security, reliability, and privacy depend on someone else.

But what if you want to own your email infrastructure and have the data in your control? You need an open-source email server, which should solve your problem.

If you are still curious, an email server lets you:

- **Build your mail backend to store email accounts**
- **Take control of the security and reliability by self-hosting**
- **Host on your preferred server architecture**
- **It gives you the ability to make unlimited accounts**

Of course, this is not for the end users. Sysadmins in small to midscale businesses, self hosters will find these software interesting.

Considering now you have an idea of the benefits of an open-source email server, here are some of the best options that you can find:
