### Trinity Desktop Environment – TDE release R14.0.12

Firstly, TDE R14.0.12 introduces Polkit-agent-tde and Polkit-tqt, which helps with the PolicyKit authentication triggered by the TQt interfaces. That means, when required, the admin password prompt is now invoked via PolicyKit for authentication. Also, a new embeddable lightweight markdown document viewer is introduced in this release.

Secondly, the list of enhancements includes the Konsole applications improvements, support for complex characters and HTML5 in Quanta (web dev editor), and support for Let’s Encrypt certificates. Not only that, TDE’s overall look is improved in addition to translation updates, and support for Python3 are some of the exciting enhancements in this release.

Moreover, on the building aspect, several packages migrated to the CMake build system while automake build system dropped for others.

Other than that, the application bug fixes include, Kaffeine seeing a fix on the libdvdcss codec detection in its player module, Amarok fixing errors for the latest Ruby programming language, and KMail correcting the email redirection to the default account.

Among all, other notable core bug fixes include a timeout fix in dbus service startup and a system hang fix during the shutdown.

Furthermore, following the other Linux distribution’s latest releases, TDE R14.0.12 introduces Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish support, dropped support for Debian Jessie and improvements for Gentoo.

All of these changes with some additional updates for developers who build applications for this KDE 3.5 tech can be found in the official changelog of TDE R14.0.12 on this [page][1].

Finally, you should be happy to know that Good ol’ Trinity Desktop Environment is available for all mainstream Linux Distribution for installation, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux, etc. A list of installation instructions is available [here][4].
