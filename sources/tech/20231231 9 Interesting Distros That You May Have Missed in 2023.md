9 Interesting Distros That You May Have Missed in 2023
======
Did you spot these releases in 2023? What distro surprised you this
year?
We saw many existing Linux distributions become better in 2023, and some new ones joining the club with a focus on immutability, among other things.

Even though there are plenty of [distros for advanced users][1], and quite a few [beginner-friendly distros][2], there were a handful that flew under the radar in 2023. These are quite different in their own right.

So, join me as I take you through **nine interesting Linux distributions** that you may have missed in 2023.

### 1\. Zinc

![][3]

[Zinc][4] is a neat **Ubuntu-based distro** that features XFCE and the Nemo File Manager, it is a relatively new offering that focuses on providing a good out-of-the box experience without the need to fiddle around much.
