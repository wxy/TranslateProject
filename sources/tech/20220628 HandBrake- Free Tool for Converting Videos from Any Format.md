HandBrake: Free Tool for Converting Videos from Any Format
======
Learn about HandBrake, an excellent utility for converting videos from any format to the destination types.

This article contains features, download instructions and a usage guide.

### HandBrake

In this age of social media, we all play around with videos, reels and, of course, the formats that come with it. So, if you are in a Linux platform or even in WIndows, you may use any other software to convert various videos for several platforms. But if you need a simple but feature-rich video converter that takes care of your all video formats from multiple sources, try HandBrake.

#### Features

HandBrake has a huge set of options that make it a unique tool. Firstly, the workflow is super easy. In fact, its just three steps:

* Select a video
* Choose a target format
* Convert

As you can see, if you are a novice user, it is super easy to work with this tool because the attributes of the target format (e.g. bit rate, dimensions) are based on the default preset.

Secondly, if you want advanced editing, such as adding subtitles from the subtitle files while converting, it is also possible using this tool.

In addition, you can also change the dimensions, flip the video, change resolutions, modify the aspect ratio, and crop. Moreover, a set of basic filter configurations such as Denoise and Sharpen can also be done.

Moreover, adding Chapters, tags and audio tracks to your video files is always easy.

Perhaps the vital feature of HandBrake is the availability of presets which cater to the modern needs of social media and streams. For example, the presets are aligned with streaming platforms and streaming devices such as:

* Discord
* GMail
* Vimeo
* Amazon Fire Stick
* Apple Devices
* Chromecast
* Playstation
* Roku
* Xbox

A pretty impressive list, isn’t it? Not only that, if you are a professional worker, it helps you define and create Queue for your conversions. The Queue feature allows you to batch convert multiple video files in your workflow.

Finally, you can convert to MPEG-4 (mp4), Matroska (mkv) and WebM formats.
