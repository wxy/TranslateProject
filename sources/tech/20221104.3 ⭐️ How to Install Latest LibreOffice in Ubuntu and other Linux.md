How to Install Latest LibreOffice in Ubuntu and other Linux
======

**Here’s a quick guide on how to install the latest LibreOffice version in Ubuntu and other Linux.**

The free and open-source office suite LibreOffice comes in two versions. The Community and Enterprise versions. The “community” version is for early adopters who want the latest bleeding-edge software tech. And the “enterprise” version is more stable and may not include all the latest features, but it is ideal for the production environment and professional work.

### Install Latest LibreOffice in Ubuntu and other Linux

#### 1. Remove pre-installed LibreOffice

The Ubuntu operating system and other Linux ideally come with pre-installed LibreOffice. That might not be the latest one because of the distribution-specific release cycles. However, before you do a fresh install, you can remove the stock version of LibreOffice in Ubuntu and its related derivatives via the below command:

Open a terminal and run the below commands to remove the installed LibreOffice in Ubuntu and related distributions. For others, you can use your distro’s package manager to remove it.

```
sudo apt remove –purge libreoffice*
sudo apt autoclean
sudo apt autoremove
```

Do a reboot to ensure everything is okay (though you could skip this step).

#### 2. Install via download

Go to the [official download page][1]. And download the “Fresh” version by choosing the type from the drop-down. For Ubuntu and other derivatives, choose the .deb file.

After downloading, extract the files; you should see all the packages below.

Now, open a terminal at the extracted files’ exact location and run the commands below in sequence. Firstly, you need to install the `ure` package. The second is the `core` package and followed by all the basic packages. Finally, the main `LibreOffice` packages. A typical set of commands are present below. You need to change the version numbers for other releases.

```
sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0-ure_7.0.4.2-2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0-core_7.0.4.2-2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libobasis7.0*
```

```
sudo dpkg -i libreoffice7.0*
```

If you are using Fedora Linux or Red Hat Linux, use the [dnf command][4] to install in the same order as mentioned above.

Wait for the installation to finish. After completion, you can find LibreOffice via the application menu.

This should complete the steps to install the latest LibreOffice. If you don’t want to follow the above method, see the below options.

#### Install via PPA

If you like to install it via PPA, then follow the below steps. Make sure to remove the existing LibreOffice in step 1 above.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa
```

And finally, run the below commands to install the latest LibreOffice 5.4 series from this official PPA.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libreoffice
```

Once installed, you can launch LibreOffice via Dash search.

#### Install via Snap and Flatpak

If you are a Linux user, you may try the LibreOffice self-contained executable, which runs in a sandbox like Snap or Flatpak.

- To install LibreOffice via [Flatpak][8], visit [this page][9] to set it up and then run the below command to install it.

```
flatpak install flathub org.libreoffice.LibreOffice
```

- Similarly, for the [Snap version][10], use the following command to install.

```
sudo snap install libreoffice
```
