5 Best Linux Phones to Watch Out for in 2023
======

**Here’s a list of the best Linux Phones which may become more mainstream in 2023 with their features and price.**

Android and iOS smartphones are the most popular ones around the world. However, many of you look for something more “open” and better at privacy. If you use Android, you forfeit your privacy. Apple’s iOS is a little better on that – but again – it’s a “walled garden”.

That’s why Linux phones are becoming popular nowadays because they contain many options for developers and end users. Although various types of Linux phones are currently available, it still becomes confusing to choose the best one. Looking at the trends of 2022, here are some of the Linux Phones which may become more mainstream in 2023.

### Things you should know about Linux Phones

Before you read or even plan to buy one, there are a couple of things you should know about. Here are some of them:

- The Linux phones use a modified version of mainstream Linux distribution with a mobile-friendly desktop environment. This is the same for most of the phones available today.
- You must manage your expectations if you plan to buy a phone and use it for your daily driver. Because the Linux phone operating systems, device features, and app ecosystem is still in the early stages, and it’s not close to the Android or iOS ecosystem,
- However, Linux phones with the operating system provide the best privacy feature, which might be the reason you can make a move.

#### Are there any mainstream Android phones that support Linux OS?

If you don’t want to buy an off-the-shelf mobile phone as listed above, then you can continue using Linux mobile OS in older branded phones because Android is a modified Linux Kernel-based. Hence these devices should work with Ubuntu Touch or PostmarketOS.

- Google Pixel 3a/3a XL
- Sony Xperia X (F5121 & F5122)
- Google Nexus 5
- OnePlus One

- Supported by Ubuntu Touch OS ([full list][12])

- Xiaomi Redmi 2
- Xiaomi Mi Note 2
- OnePlus GT
- OnePlus 6

- Supported by PostmarketOS ([full list][13])

### Closing notes

So, that’s about the best Linux phones available in the market today and will continue in 2023. You can learn more about the above devices from the official website. However, I believe there will be more adoption of Linux phones in the coming days as Privacy becomes a myth every day.

It’s true that to compete with Android and iOS, the device or OS is not sufficient. What is important is the standard, global availability for buying, low entry-level pricing in emerging markets and investment in the app ecosystem. A streamlined vision is required in the phone ecosystem to win. Without it, Linux phones will become more fragmented, as in desktops. The device makers and major FOSS players need to work together to make it successful.
