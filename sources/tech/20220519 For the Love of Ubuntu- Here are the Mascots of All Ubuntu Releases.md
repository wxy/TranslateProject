For the Love of Ubuntu: Here are the Mascots of All Ubuntu Releases
======
This is a collection of the mascots of all the Ubuntu releases so far.

You may have noticed that every Ubuntu release has a version name and codename. The codename is composed of two words that start with the same letter. The first word is an adjective, and the other one is (usually) an (endangered) species.

These releases also have a mascot for those codenames. Ubuntu 22.04 is codenamed Jammy Jellyfish and hence the Jellyfish mascot on its wallpaper.

These ‘mascots’ were not always part of Ubuntu releases. The codenames were always there, but not the mascots.

The first-ever Ubuntu release was version 4.10 in October 2004. But it wasn’t until the Ubuntu 8.04 LTS ‘Hardy Heron’ release that you saw the associated mascot.

Earlier, I complied the [list of the default wallpapers of all Ubuntu releases][1]. In this one, you get to look at the mascots of those releases.

Let’s hop on to Ubuntu’s mascot journey in reverse chronological order.

### Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish

### Conclusion

Does this article add value to an Ubuntu user? Not technically, but it’s good to look back at the history. If you have been an Ubuntu user for years, it could trigger nostalgia.

Ubuntu 9.04 was the first time I tried Linux on a desktop. It was in late September of 2009 if I recall correctly. Only a few weeks later, my system was upgraded to Ubuntu 9.10. I used to spend time browing in Ubuntu Forum thoses days, exploring this new OS and learning new things.

So, did this article bring back some good old memories? Which was your first Ubuntu version? Share it in the comments.
