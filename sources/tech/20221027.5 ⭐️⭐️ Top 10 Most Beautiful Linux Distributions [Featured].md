Top 10 Most Beautiful Linux Distributions [Featured]
======

**We give you the top 10 beautiful Linux Distributions of 2022. They are a visual treat to your eyes while being a robust operating system.**

The most fantastic thing about [Linux Distributions][1] is you can customize them to any extent to satisfy your visual needs. Whether based on Ubuntu or Fedora, you have all the tools you need to customize a Linux desktop.

But, there are many Linux Distributions that looks stunning without any customization. The developers have made them so that you can experience the visual treat right after installation without any additional effort on customization.

Hence, we compiled a list of the most beautiful Linux distributions you can try right now and give your PC a visual makeover.

### Most Beautiful Linux Distributions of 2022

#### 1. Zorin OS

The first Linux Distribution which we would like to feature is Zorin OS. The Zorin OS is a beautiful Linux distribution that uses Zorin Desktop based on GNOME. It is perfect for newcomers who want a nice desktop but are also productive at the same time.

One unique feature of Zorin OS is its ability to transform its look to make it like any other operating system. That means the taskbar, application menu, and Dock can change with just one click option from its Layout settings, giving you the utmost flexibility and out-of-the-box experience while using ZorinOS.

#### 2. Elementary OS

The elementaryOS is one of the most beautiful Linux distributions today based on Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) release. This Linux Distribution uses the stunning Pantheon Desktop environment, whose look and feel is inspired by macOS.

The elementary OS is perfect for those coming from macOS to the Linux world as they would find many things familiar, such as gestures and window decorations.

However, you may not find many customization options available in elementary OS settings. You may need to depend on external script commands to make further customization. However, the default looks are beautiful and serve their purpose for the majority of users.

The most significant advantage of elementary OS is its curated app store. The App Store provides you with all categories of applications specially designed for the elementary OS, which looks and works great.

The third distribution which we would like to highlight is Deepin OS. The Deepin OS is based on Debian and was created by Deepin Technology Co from China. It uses its own Deepin Desktop Environment based on Qt. The Deepin desktop looks incredible with its widgets, colour schemes, window decorations, and wallpapers that give you an out-of-the-box visual treat.

With its well-polished visual components, you may think that it looks almost similar to macOS. And thanks to the Debian “stable” branch, Deepin OS is the perfect choice if you want an excellent-looking Linux distribution with stability.

#### 7. Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition

We all love Linux Mint because of its simplicity, elegance and stability. It is one of the most widely used and famous Linux distributions today. And perhaps the most used Linux distribution after Ubuntu. However, it is not that fancy-looking if you compare this with other Linux Distributions here in this list.

But the default Cinnamon desktop looks clean and perfect if you like the legacy user interface, which looks fantastic.

The Linux Mint Cinnamon edition is perfect for all users, especially new users of Linux or even those are migrating from Windows. The default looks and feels with Mint’s green colour palette look refreshing.

If you cannot decide on an eye-candy Linux distribution with stability, choose the Linux Mint Cinnamon edition without a doubt.
