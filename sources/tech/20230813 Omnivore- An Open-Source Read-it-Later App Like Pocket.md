Omnivore: An Open-Source Read-it-Later App Like Pocket
======
An open-source alternative to Mozilla's Pocket with exciting features.
What if I told you there's a one-stop solution to all your read-it-later needs?

You know, when you come across interesting articles you want to read but don't have the time to read them right then.

That is where a read-it-later solution comes in. In this article, we will look at a cross-platform, open-source read-it-later platform called ' **Omnivore** ' that facilitates such tasks.

Allow me to show you what it has to offer.

### Omnivore: Overview ‚≠ê

![][1]

Powered primarily by **HTML** , and **TypeScript** , Omnivore **aims to be an all-in-one solution** for all your reading needs.

It sounds like an alternative to the ever-popular [Pocket][2] app by Mozilla.

You can use it across many platforms, such as **Web** , **Android** , and **iOS**.

You can also self-host it on a server, though Omnivore was initially designed to be deployed on [GCP][3] (Google Cloud Platform). Luckily, the developers are working on a more inclusive deployment system, that will make it more portable.

So, let us begin by taking a look at some key highlights of Omnivore:

  * **Support for full-keyboard navigation.**
  * **Autosave of progress in long articles.**
  * **Support for various plugins.**
  * **Offline reading functionality.**



#### Initial Impressions üë®‚Äçüíª

I tested the free-hosted version of Omnivore, where you have to create an account.

After account creation, I set it up with a few articles to read later, and the result was this **well-organized homepage**.

It features a sidebar menu comprising category options like **Inbox, Continue Reading, Read Later, Unlabeled** and more.

The main grid layout houses all the saved articles; it also had an alternate list-style view, but I opted for the grid view.

So, moving on. Let me show you **how to add articles to Omnivore**.

There are two main ways of saving articles for reading later on Omnivore.

One is **through the user menu** , where you have to click on ‚Äú **Add Link** ‚Äù, and then paste the URL into the text box that appears when you click on it.

![][5]

But the other way is far more intuitive; it is **via browser extensions**. I tested it on Vivaldi using the Omnivore extension from the [Chrome Web Store][6].

After installing it, you simply have to visit an article of interest and click on the Omnivore logo that shows up in the extensions bar of your browser.

![][7]

The article will then be added to your Omnivore account; you can also make use of the available options to **add notes, labels, edit titles** , and more.

Don't worry; this is not a Chromium-only affair. You can get browser extensions for [Firefox][8] and [Safari][9] too, which is a good thing.

Post that, I went on to take a look at **the ‚ÄúLabels‚Äù system on Omnivore**. I had created two labels and assigned them to the saved articles accordingly.

It allowed me to sort them by label. I just had to click on the one I wanted to access.

![Click to enlarge the image][10]

For creating new labels, click on the three-dot menu beside ‚Äú **Labels** ‚Äù on the sidebar menu and proceed to edit.

![][11]

Next, you can get started by adding a label or modifying the existing ones, giving them a name and color.

![][12]

To assign them to existing articles, hover over an article card, go into the three-dot menu, and choose ‚Äú **Set Labels**.‚Äù

I then proceeded to see the **article-reading experience** , and I was not disappointed. The article viewer had a clean layout with a floating sidebar menu that allowed for a range of functionality.

The first option was to set labels to the article; the second one opens up a notebook that lets you add notes to the specific article.

![Click to enlarge the image][13]

Then there's the ‚ÄúEdit Info‚Äù button that opens up an editing window for editing critical details of a saved article. And finally, the last two buttons are for deleting or archiving the saved article.

I then moved on to check out the plugin's support **on Omnivore**. It supports quite a few, allowing you to export content from there.

You can connect it to [Logseq][15], [Obsidian][16], [Readwise][17], and even Mozilla's [Pocket][2].

This level of interoperability is always a plus in my books! ü§ì

![][18]

And this last one came as a surprise to me.

Omnivore **supports the creation of email aliases** that can then be used to sign up for various newsletters. Officially, they support newsletters from [Substack][19], [beehiv][20], [Axios][21], and more.

![][22]

But, as it turns out, it works on other newsletters too. I tested it out on **[our newsletter][23]** , and it integrated well!

### üì• Get Omnivore

If you are like me and want to get started conveniently, I suggest you visit the [official website][24].

However, if you are more into self-hosting it, I recommend you take a look at the [official documentation][25] and its [GitHub repo][26].

[Omnivore][24]

**As for their pricing structure** , currently, Omnivore is entirely free. The developers have not decided on a proper pricing plan but have a few ideas in the pipeline they intend to pursue.

Presently, they rely entirely on donations from the community.

_üí¨ What are your thoughts on this? Will you be giving this a try?_
