13 Best Open Source ChatGPT Alternatives
======

ChatGPT is a powerful generative AI tool developed by OpenAI. You enter text prompts in a conversational way, and it gives you a detailed response.

Sure, it is not perfect. But, sometimes it is incredibly helpful. No matter what you do with it, unfortunately, it is not an open-source solution.

As a proprietary option, it isn't beneficial in every way. So, what are some open source ChatGPT alternatives? Here, let me highlight the best ChatGPT alternatives that are open-source in nature.

üìã

Not all ChatGPT alternatives function the same way. Some solutions are purely meant for developers to create their own chatbot on top of it. And, a few others offer a chatbot or demo for you to test.

### Reasons to Look for Open-Source ChatGPT Alternatives

Relying on any single service is bad for the consumers. The same goes for ChatGPT.

In addition to that, here's why we should look for open ChatGPT alternatives:

  * Get transparency on how our data is being handled.
  * You can choose to build your own solution, saving money in the process.
  * Customize the ChatGPT alternative as per your requirements.
  * You are not locked on to the policies of a single company. The open-source solution can be flexible as per your needs.
  * Contributions to the open-source project will make an impact on everyone across the globe.



I do not intend to say that ChatGPT is bad, or you should stop using it. However, "we" as the users should benefit more from the open alternatives in the long-run.

Now, let us move on to the best open-source ChatGPT alternatives.

Not all demos allow commercial use. You need to be careful when using the content from the chatbot demos for some options.

You can try if it fits your use-cases and explore its [GitHub page][6] for technical details.

### 2\. ChatRWKV

Vicuna is yet another open-source chatbot trained on top of LLaMA. As per the developers, when evaluated using GPT-4 as a judge, it concluded that it comes close to the quality of ChatGPT.

An interesting claim that you might want to test against. You can select the language model Vicuna and try it on [Chatbot Arena][23].

Explore more about it on its [official blog post][24].

### 9\. Alpaca-LoRA

Alpaca-Lora aims to provide an instruct model using low-rank adaptation, letting you run it on a Raspberry Pi.

Dolly is another language model trained in the Databricks machine learning platform licensed for commercial use.

You can take a look at the source code on [GitHub][27] and explore the model on [Huggingface][28].

### 11\. H2oGPT

![][29]

H2oGPT is tailored for queries to help you summarize your documents. To achieve that, it lets you upload and view documents through its user interface, which is private to you.
