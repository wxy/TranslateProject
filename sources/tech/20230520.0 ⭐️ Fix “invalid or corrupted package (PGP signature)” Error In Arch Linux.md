Fix “invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)” Error In Arch Linux
======

**A simple guide to fix the “invalid or corrupted package” error in Arch Linux.**

I have a few Arch Linux systems in both physical and VM setup, which I access when needed. After almost two months, when I tried to upgrade the Arch Linux in one of them using `sudo pacman -Syu`, I got hundreds of errors like this:

![Sample invalid or corrupted package error in Arch Linux][1]

The problem is when you get the above error, you can not upgrade/update your Arch system. Even if you sync the mirrors or get a faster one. So, if you run `sudo pacman -Syyu`, the error will still be there. This is also problematic since you can’t install any additional packages until this is fixed.

### Cause

When you install or upgrade packages on an Arch Linux system, pacman checks the digital signatures of the packages against the keys in the `archlinux-keyring` package. This verification process ensures that the packages you download and install are unmodified and come from trusted sources.

It contains the public keyring used to [verify the authenticity and integrity of packages][2] and in pacman. The `archlinux-keyring` package is regularly updated by the Arch Linux developers to include new trusted keys and revoke any compromised keys.

If you have not updated your Arch Linux system for a longer period, then the digital signatures of various packages may mismatch. The changed keys may not match what you have in your system.

Hence the error.

### Fix

To fix “invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)” error in Arch Linux, you need to install/update the `archlinux-keyring` package from the `Core` repo. Run the following from the terminal:

```
sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring
```

After the above command is complete, run the upgrade:

```
sudo pacman -Syu
```

This will resolve the problem, and you can continue your normal activity in Arch Linux. It’s recommended to always keep the `archlinux-keyring` package up to date to maintain the security and integrity of your Arch Linux system.
