10 Beautiful Fonts for Your Linux Terminal
======

Picking the perfect font is crucial for many things, whether you are a programmer, system administrator, or a Linux user fond of the terminal.

[Changing the terminal font][1] helps you achieve the following:

- **An aesthetically pleasing look of your terminal**
- **Enhances readability**
- **Reduces eye strain**

Sounds good. But how can you choose the perfect font? There are hundreds and thousands of options out there.

For starters, you can select a **font optimized for technical documents or coding** because those have good readability. Next, you can filter **foss projects** (if that matters to you) and check if those **fonts scale well** with high-resolution monitors (per your requirements).

Fret not; to give you a head start, we have picked some of the best fonts fit for coding, offering good readability while also looking good at the same time.
