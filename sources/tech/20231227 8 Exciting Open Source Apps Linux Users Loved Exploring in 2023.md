8 Exciting Open Source Apps Linux Users Loved Exploring in 2023
======
The best underrated apps that we discovered in 2023.
We have been covering applications, distributions, and plenty of other interesting open-source projects throughout 2023.

Of course, as an open-source enthusiast or a Linux user, our readers loved trying out the applications we curated.

So, now that the year is coming to an end, I do not want you to miss some of those nifty applications. You never know, you may find something that you may not stop using at all.

Here are the apps that I think you should not miss taking a look at:

### 1\. Warp: Secure File Sharing App

![][1]

[Warp][2] is a Rust-based open-source file-sharing app. It is available for Linux, Windows, and Android.

The functioning of it is seamless where the entire communication is encrypted. You need a transmit code to authorize/receive the file, so no one else accidentally gets what you are trying to send.

You can explore all about it in our coverage:

### 2\. MusicPod: A Beautiful Music Player

![][4]

If you are looking for a music player offering a good user experience with support for podcasts and radio stations, [MusicPod][5] is a nice pick.

It is a Flutter-based app that provides an intuitive user interface with essential controls for music playback. Of course, if this is not something to your taste, feel free to check out our list of the [best music players for Linux][6].

MusicPod is a Linux-only app available as a Snap package. Explore more about it here:

### 3\. Pano Clipboard Manager: GNOME Extension

![][7]

For GNOME users, [Pano Clipboard Manager][8] is a useful extension to have installed.

Sure, you can always use apps like [CopyQ][9] as a reliable clipboard manager. However, Pano is an extension that makes keeping track of clipboard content visually intuitive.

It displays all the colors/links/images you have in your clipboard and lets you adjust its appearance as well.

You can also check out our recommended [list of clipboard managers][10] for other options:

### 4\. Beaver Notes: Private Note-Taking App

![][12]

There are various [note-taking applications on Linux][13]. But, if you have tried most of them, and want something simple, straightforward, and privacy-focused, [Beaver Notes][14] is a good candidate.

You do not get a lot of features, but the ability to use Markdown for note-taking, and essentials to organize your notes.

We took it for a spin early this year, check it out to get a sneak peek:

### 5\. Wave: A Modern Linux Terminal

![][15]

If you are a command-line fan, but the user experience has held you back, Wave is an impressive terminal emulator to try.

It offers a code-editor-like UI, which is easy to understand, even for newbies. You get all the essentials at a glance, making things accessible and organized simultaneously.

Not just the UX side of things, it also provides plenty of useful features like the ability to save persistent SSH connections. You can explore more about it in our coverage:

### 6\. Xplorer: A Nice File Manager

![][16]

Most of you must be content with the default file managers baked in with the Linux distributions.

However, if you want to experiment with things, Xplorer is a pretty file manager with some customization options.

While the development for the app is not as active as other options, with more contributors, it looks like something with good potential. Take a better look at it here:

### 7\. Mission Center: System Monitoring App

Want to get more details on your system resources? Including per-thread usage stats?

Mission Center is the perfect GUI system monitoring app. You can explore more about it in our coverage on it:
