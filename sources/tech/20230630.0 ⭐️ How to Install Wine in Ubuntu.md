How to Install Wine in Ubuntu
======

With some effort, you can [run Windows applications on Linux][1] using Wine. Wine is a tool you can try when must use an Windows-only application on Linux.

Please note that **you CANNOT run any Windows games or software with Wine**. Please go through the [database of supported applications][2]. The software rated platinum or gold have a higher chance of running smoothly with Wine.

If you have found a Windows-only software that [Wine][3] supports well and now looking to use it, this tutorial will help you with the Wine installation on Ubuntu.

> üí° If you have Wine installed before, you should remove it completely to avoid any conflict. Also, you should refer to its [download page][4] for additional instructions for specific Linux distributions.

### Installing Wine on Ubuntu

There are various ways to install Wine on your system. Almost all the Linux distros come with Wine in their package repository.

Most of the time, the latest stable version of Wine is available via the package repository.

- **Install WINE from Ubuntu‚Äôs repository (easy but may not be the latest version)**
- **Install WINE from Wine‚Äôs repository (slightly more complicated but gives the latest version)**

Please be patient and follow the steps one by one to install and use Wine. There are several steps involved here.

> üöß Keep in mind that Wine installs too many packages. You will see a massive list of packages and install sizes of around 1.3 GB.

![Wine download and installed size][5]

#### Method 1. Install WINE from Ubuntu (easy)

Wine is available in Ubuntu's Official repositories, where you can easily install it. However, the version available this way may not be the latest.

Even if you are using a 64-bit installation of Ubuntu, you will need to add 32-bit architecture support on your distro, which will benefit you in installing specific software.

Type in the commands below:

```
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
```

Then install Wine using:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wine
```

#### Method 2: Install the latest version from Wine‚Äôs repository

Wine is one such program that receives heavy developments in a short period. So, it is always recommended to install the latest stable version of Wine to get more software support.

**First, remove any existing Wine installation**.

**Step 1**: Make sure to add 32-bit architecture support:

```
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
```

**Step 2**: Download and add the repository key:

```
sudo mkdir -pm755 /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/winehq-archive.key https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key
```

**Step 3**: Now download the WineHQ sources file.

> üöß This step depends on the Ubuntu or Mint version you are using. Please [check your Ubuntu version][6] or [Mint version][7]. Once you have that information, use the commands for your respective versions.

For **Ubuntu 23.04 Lunar Lobster**, use the command below:

```
sudo wget -NP /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/lunar/winehq-lunar.sources
```

If you have **Ubuntu 22.04 or Linux Mint 21.X series**, use the command below:

```
sudo wget -NP /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/jammy/winehq-jammy.sources
```

If you are running **Ubuntu 20.04 or Linux Mint 20.X series**, use:

```
sudo wget -NP /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/focal/winehq-focal.sources
```

**Ubuntu 18.04 or Linux Mint 19.X series** users can use the command below to add the sources file:

```
sudo wget -NP /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/bionic/winehq-bionic.sources
```

Once done, update the package information and install the wine-stable package.

```
sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable
```

If you want the development or staging version, use `winehq-devel` or `winehq-staging` respectively.

### Initial Wine configuration

Once Wine is installed, run the following:

```
winecfg
```

This will create the **virtual C: Drive** for installing Windows applications.

![C: Drive created by winecfg in Home directory][8]

While following these steps, sometimes, you may not find the ‚Äú**Open With Wine Windows Program Loader**‚Äù option in Nautilus right-click menu.

In that case, fix it by [creating a soft link][9] to appropriate directory:

```
sudo ln -s /usr/share/doc/wine/examples/wine.desktop /usr/share/applications/
```

And restart your system to get the change.

### Using Wine to run Windows applications

Once you have installed Wine and configured it by running `winecfg`, now is the time to install Windows apps.

Here, the 7Zip.exe file is used for demonstration purposes. I know I should have used a better example, as 7Zip is available on Linux. Still, the process remains the same for other applications.

Firstly, download the 7Zip .exe file from their [official downloads page][10].

Now, right-click on the file and select "Open With Wine Windows Program Loader" option:

![Open 7zip exe file using Wine WIndows Program Loader in Nemo file manager][11]

This will prompt us to install the file. Click **Install** and let it complete. Once done, you can open the 7zip like any other native app.

You can use `wine uninstaller` command to uninstall any installed application.

Here's a dedicated tutorial on [using Wine to run Windows software][1] on Linux:

### Remove Wine from Ubuntu

If you don't find Wine interesting or if Wine doesn't run the application you want properly, you may need to uninstall Wine. To do this, follow the below steps.

**Remove Wine installed through the Ubuntu repository**

To remove wine installed through repositories, first run:

```
sudo apt remove --purge wine
```

Update your package information:

```
sudo apt update
```

Now, use the `autoclean` command to clear the local repository of retrieved package files that are virtually useless.

```
sudo apt-get autoclean
sudo apt-get clean
```

Remove those packages that are installed but no longer required using:

```
sudo apt autoremove
```

Now reboot the system.

**Remove Wine installed through the Wine repository**

Remove the installed `wine-stable` package.

```
sudo apt remove --purge wine-stable
```

Update your package information:

```
sudo apt update
```

Now, use the `autoclean` and `clean` command to clear the local repository of retrieved package files that are virtually useless.

```
sudo apt-get autoclean
sudo apt-get clean
```

Now remove the sources file added earlier. Use your respective distribution folder. Here, Ubuntu 22.04 is used.

```
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winehq-jammy.sources
```

Once this is removed, update your system package information:

```
sudo apt update
```

Optionally, remove the key file you had added earlier if you want.

```
sudo rm /etc/apt/keyrings/winehq-archive.key
```

Now remove any residual files manually.

### Still have questions about using Wine?

You may also go through our tutorial on using Wine. It should answer some more questions you might have.

There is no place better than the Wine Project website. They have a dedicated FAQ (frequently asked questions) page:

[Wine FAQs][13]

If you still have questions, you can browse through [their wiki][14] for detailed [documentation][15] or ask your doubts in [their forum][16].

Alternatively, if you don't mind spending some money, you can opt for CrossOver. It's basically Wine but with premium support. You can also contact their team for your questions.

In my opinion, you should resort to Wine only when you cannot find an alternative to the software you must use. Even in that case, it's not guaranteed to work with Wine.

And yet, Wine provides some hope for Windows migrants to Linux.
