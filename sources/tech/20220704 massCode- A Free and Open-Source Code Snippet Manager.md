massCode: A Free and Open-Source Code Snippet Manager
======
Brief: An open-source code snippet manager that enables you to dabble with code, improve productivity, and save time.

If a tool makes things faster and efficient, that is a life-saver for many developers.

While there are different services and platforms that try to make the coding experience quicker, you still have several other options to consider.

For instance, a code snippet manager. With a snippet manager, you aim to save a section of code that you want to quickly access. It is more like assigning shortcuts to add the required code in your program.

This is not a new concept, but the tools available for the job may not be entirely open-source.

Fortunately, I stumbled upon a decent project that provides you with a free and open-source snippet manager, i.e., massCode.

### massCode: Cross-Platform Open-Source Snippet Manager

![masscode][1]

massCode is a useful snippet manager with some essential features.

It supports a wide range of programming languages and also includes Markdown support. You can organize the snippets of your code using folders, add tags, and more.

massCode is available for Linux, Windows, or macOS. Let’s take a look at some key features.

### Features of massCode

![masscode screenshot][2]

massCode includes many useful functionalities. Some of them are:

* Multi-level folder organizer
* Each snippet can be stored in fragments (tabs)
* Integrated coding editor, i.e., [Ace][3].
* Code formatting or highlighting.
* Markdown support with preview.
* The ability to search for a snippet.
* Add descriptions to your snippet to know what it is for.
* Variety of dark/light themes available.
* Ability to migrate from [SnippetsLab][4].
* Auto-save to help you retain your work.
* Integrate it with cloud synchronization folders.
* Extension support for VSCode, Raycast, and Alfred.

In addition to all the features mentioned, you also get to easily copy the code snippets saved in a single click.

For customization, you can tweak the font size and family, toggle Word Wrap, highlight lines, use single quotes, or add a trailing command thanks to [Prettier][5].

Moreover, you can have multiple fragments for a snippet. So, it gives you the opportunity to use it for a wide range of use cases.

As mentioned, you can also integrate it with any of your cloud syncing services by changing the storage location to the synced folders.

Overall, it works well, with some limitations, like the ability to migrate nested folders from SnippetsLab to massCode.

### Install massCode on Linux

massCode is available as a [Snap package][7], but not on the Snap store. You can download the package directly and use the following command to get it installed:

```
sudo snap install --dangerous ~/Downloads/masscode_2.6.1_amd64.snap
```

One of our troubleshooting guides can help you know more about the [dangerous snap flag][8].

You can download it for Windows/macOS through its [official website][9] or its [GitHub releases section][10].
