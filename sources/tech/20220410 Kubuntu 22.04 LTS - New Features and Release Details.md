### Kubuntu 22.04 LTS New Features

Perhaps the most popular Ubuntu-based Linux distribution is the Kubuntu in terms of usability, appearance and stability. Linux Kernel 5.15 LTS powers the Kubuntu 22.04 LTS same as the Ubuntu base. Also, it features the [KDE Plasma 5.24.x series][2], which is the current LTS version of the Plasma desktop.

Besides, the KDE Plasma 5.24.x series is the 26th edition of KDE Plasma desktop and brings some stunning features such as overview effect, new notification, etc. Although it is not the latest Plasma as of today, it’s the last stable version.

On the other hand, if you compare the last Kubuntu 20.04 LTS with this version, a whole lot of changes you should expect. First and foremost, Kubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa had KDE Plasma 5.18 compared to today’s 5.24 series. You can expect a vast set of new features and a completely different desktop improved for better accessibility and performance. Secondly, KDE Plasma 5.24 is supported by Qt 5.15.2 and KDE Frameworks 5.90, which is also a jump since the last Kbuntu Focal Fossa.

Undoubtedly, the significant feature that you can experience is the newly designed overview screen of the Plasma desktop. You can launch it using Meta+W key combinations and must have multiple virtual machines. The new overview screen reminds you about GNOME’s application view. The view gives you the virtual desktop thumbnails at the top, and in the middle, you can see the list of open windows for the virtual desktops. It also gives you a search option which makes you faster at finding your applications.

This version of Plasma also brings a custom accent colour option that triggers your imagination for a beautiful desktop. On top of that, a refreshed Breeze Classic theme and re-designed font size make this version a perfect one to feature in an LTS release.
