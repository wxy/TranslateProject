Meet 'Clipboard': An Open-Source App That Aims to Turn Up Your Productivity
======

The clipboard app is a useful open-source tool with lots of features to improve your productivity.

Want a new, 𝘳𝘪𝘥𝘰𝘯𝘬𝘶𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘰𝘶𝘴𝘭𝘺 smart clipboard manager? 🤔

That is what the folks behind **The Clipboard Project** think of their clipboard manager. They call it a 'second brain' that remembers anything, anytime, anywhere.

So, what do you say? Let us take a look at it:

### Clipboard: Overview ⭐

Written primarily in the venerable **C++ programming language**, [Clipboard][3] offers a number of features such as copying/pasting text, files, directories, binary data, infinite clipboards, and more!

Furthermore, it **seamlessly integrates with major GUI clipboard systems** and supports languages like Español, Portuguese, and Türkçe.

Let me show you how it works.

> 📋 Since this is a terminal-based app, you must use various commands to operate Clipboard.

So, the first thing you will be doing is to copy the contents of a file by using the following command:

```
cb copy 'filename'
```

Then to paste, you can use the following:

```
cb paste
```

For loading all your clipboards, you can use this command:

```
cb show
```

And finally, the feature that grabbed our attention the most was the recently added **unlimited clipboard history** feature.

You can use this command to access the complete clipboard history:

```
cb hs
```

Clipboard should **appeal to users who prefer using terminal-based apps** over GUI-based apps; it offers a very minimal user experience with all the right tools to go with it.

Not to forget, it is packed with more features than I discussed, some of which include:

- Make scripts to automate your workflows
- Ability to paste every type of data you have got, including binary data

Those who prefer apps with a graphical interface can opt for [Pano clipboard manager][8]. It is a lightweight clipboard manager that integrates quite well with GNOME.

### 📥 Get Clipboard

You can begin your Clipboard journey by getting it from [GitHub][9] or exploring its [official website][10]. It also contains all the necessary installation guides and documentation.
