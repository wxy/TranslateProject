#### Podcasts – podcast client

We all love Podcasts, and it’s still going strong. Podcasts are native GNOME applications that cover all of your podcast needs. Armed with nice and clean UI, Podcasts offers you unique features such as remembering where you stopped listening to start over where you left off. Also, this application can integrate with popular podcast services such as iTunes, Soundcloud, etc.

Here’s a quick summary of the features:

* Nice and clean user interface UI
* Play, update and complete management of your podcasts from UI
* Well, integration with GNOME Desktop such as notifications.
* Bookmark your listening to start listening over again
* Support of RSS/Atop for podcasting service via Soundcloud and iTunes

#### Tootle – Mastodon client

The next app we would like to feature is Tootle – a Mastodon client for the GNOME desktop. Mastodon is a decentralized, microblogging platform gaining momentum considering privacy and other modern matters. So, that said, Tootle is an excellent little utility for accessing Mastodon and helps you to “Toot” (like “Tweet” for Twitter) contents of your choice.

This application well integrates with the GNOME desktop and comes with a Flatpak build for installation.

#### Tangram – Web app browser

This application is one of my favourites. And I am sure it would be for you as well. Tangram is a browser for Web Apps. Web Apps behaves as desktop apps for your favourite websites. So, using Tangram, you can manage your multiple web applications together with its unique vertical tab browser.

Each of the tabs is persistent and independent. That means, for example, you can open multiple Google accounts together in separate tabs without worrying about login conflicts or expiry. You can also group the type of web apps using this application. Suppose you would like to group all messager applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook Meeesagner & Telegram. In that case, you can do that quickly, and it’s easier for you to monitor and be productive.

If used and appropriately configured, Tangram can reduce digital notification overhead in your mobile, save time and eventually help you focus more.

* Multiple languages
* Search suggestions
* List of recent articles
* Simple bookmarks management
* Text search in articles
* Article table of contents

#### Devhelp – API Browser

The next app we would like to highlight is Devhelp. As its name says, this desktop application is created to help developers give them offline access to API documentation. Yes, you read it right. If installed locally, you can browse API documentation without internet connections. A perfect app for developers who travels frequently and may not have internet connections available on the go.

By default, it comes with GTK-doc, i.e. GTK documentation are available as per the installations. However, you can configure it for other development languages provided; you have the API documentation HTML and *.devhelp2 index file is generated.

A fantastic tool, I must say.

#### Lorem – Random Text Generator

We often need placeholder text for various needs. And for that, the famous “Lorem Ipsum” text is widely used. It is mainly used by web developers, documentation writers or specific applications where you need to put some text to demonstrate a specific font size, colour or some functionalities.

This GNOME app, named Lorem, does just that. Based on your input, it can generate blocks of text that you can easily copy and use for your work.

Rnote is an excellent application for taking handwritten notes via touch devices. This application is vector image-based and helps to draw annotate pictures and PDFs. It brings native .rnote file format with import/export options for png, jpeg, SVG and PDF.

One of the cool features of Rnote is that it supports [Xournal++ file format][35] support which makes it a must-have tool.

Using this GNOME application, you can easily upload photos directly to your account, add tags, modify descriptions, add geolocation data and many such actions. You can also manage multiple Flickr accounts using this utility.

It is a perfect application for those whose workflow deals with heavy photo management and doesn’t want to deal with web browsers.

#### GTG – Getting Things GNOME: To do manager

Are you procrastinating too much or having trouble finishing small to larger tasks in your day to day life. Then this next application is perfect for you. GTG, aka Getting Things Gnome, is one of the best personal tasks and to-do managers and organizers for GNOME Desktop. It is inspired by the[Getting Things Done methodology][45] and brings more features to manage your time while accomplishing tasks perfectly.

GTG user interface is neat with flexibility that helps you create and manage tasks with tagging, dependencies, colour codes, search, and many search features. If you have not tried this app yet, you should check it out.

#### Recipes – Cooking helper

And the final application in this list has something to do with cooking. Everyone (who cooks regularly) deals with the question – “what should I cook today?” Right. To help those poor GNOME chefs, GNOME has an app called Recipes.

Right from its user interface, you can discover what to cook today, tomorrow or even the rest of the week! You can search and explore types of recipes such as Vegan, Nut-free recipes etc. The featured Chef section is one of its best features while exploring mouth-watering recipes from fellow GNOME users.
