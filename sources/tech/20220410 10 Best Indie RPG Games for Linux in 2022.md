10 Best Indie RPG Games for Linux in 2022
======

Whether it is Windows, Linux, or macOS, you will find plenty of Indie games to play.

There are chances to find incredibly exciting games that are often underrated, which makes it exciting to explore Indie games.

But, here, I focus only on the best Indie RPG games (i.e. developed by small teams) available for the Linux platform.

It does not matter if you have an entry-level gaming setup, most Indie games should work perfectly fine on a range of computers (even with integrated graphics).

Note that the list of games includes listing (in no particular ranking order) from Steam, and contains free and paid games.

If you are an avid gamer who spends plenty of time and money on gaming, you should subscribe to Humble Monthly. This monthly subscription program from [Humble Bundle][1] (affiliate link, please read our [affiliate policy][2]) gives you $100 in games for just $12 each month.

Not all games might be available on Linux, but it is still a good deal because you get an additional 10% discount on any games or books you buy from the Humble Bundle website.

The best thing here is that every purchase you make supports a charity organization. So, you are not just gaming; you are also making a difference in the world.

Valheim is an incredibly impressive indie title that is still in its early access phase.

It presents you with the experience to explore and survive while playing with up to 10 players. You can choose to play solo or continue with the multiplayer experience.

The world looks beautiful for indie development, and the game is constantly improving with time. It is a paid game available on Steam for **$19.99** and supports Linux as a native platform.

### 2\. Undertale

Undertale is an interesting RPG title where you do not have to kill anyone. You can just negotiate your way out of danger using its battle system.

The game revolves around a human who falls underground into the world of monsters. Surprisingly, you can date a skeleton and also become friends with all the bosses.

So, you are in for a happy ride when you start playing this game.

ARK Survival Evolved is a survival and exploration game that takes place in a beautiful setting with dinosaurs and other creatures.

You need to craft, harvest resources, hunt, tame creatures, breed them, and more to survive and escape.

It may not entirely feel like an indie title, but it does its best to give you an AAA-like experience with games.

A procedural storytelling RPG title where tactical combat and your decisions will affect the world and characters.

You get to fight evil with your cast of heroes and follow them through their entire careers. It is not just any other RPG indie game but one offering character depth to engross yourself.

Rakuen is an interesting RPG adventure game about a little boy living in the hospital.

The story revolves around the boy completing challenges by helping his neighbors in the hospital while dealing with their alter-egos in the fantasy world.

The boy’s mom promised to escort him to the fantasy world from his favorite storybook, given that he completed all these challenges. The interaction takes you on a roller coaster of emotions including happy, sad, thoughtful, and funny reflections as well.

The game costs $9.9 on Steam.

#### 7\. Darkwood

![][15]

Darkwood is a one-of-a-kind survival horror RPG game with a top-down perspective.

You may think that it should be a basic experience with the top-down approach, but impressively it manages to offer an immersive experience where your decision matters. There are no quest markers in this free-roaming world, so it should be a challenging experience.

#### 8\. WAFKU

![][17]

WAFKU is an action-packed massively multiplayer online RPG universe.

It features an interesting set of characters and gives a fantastic taste of turn-based tactical combat. Every class has a unique set of skills. And, you will find 18 of them in the game.

So, you can explore/choose what suits your gameplay style.

You get to build your own world, take control of the ecosystem, and also get involved with political life, sounds interesting, right?

#### 9\. Mechajammer

![][19]

Mechajammer is an interesting RPG game with exciting visuals.

With a turn-based cyberpunk setting, you are in for a refreshing experience. You get to choose a vehicle, or weapon, pick a side quest with a gang, and do other things.

A good blend of open-world exploration and turn-based fight that should challenge you. You get a lot of customization options, including the ability to tweak your character.

It may not be a popular pick, but it has been praised as a hardcore classic-style RPG game.

#### 10\. Finding Paradise
