Top 10 Best GNOME Extensions in 2022
======
You can try a list of 10 finest GNOME Extensions in 2022 in Ubuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions. Take a look.

It’s time to refresh the list of best GNOME Extensions that we [featured][1] sometime back. The primary reason is the iconic GNOME 42 release that brings GTK4, libadwaita, native dark style and much more updates.

As GNOME progresses towards a more user-friendly experience, the extension ecosystem also evolves with updated features and extensions for the latest GNOME desktop. Many extensions were discontinued because of lack of interest or simply not being relevant with GNOME versions.

One of the critical aspects of extension is that with every new GNOME release, the extensions require updates conforming to the latest GNOME version. At the same time, this ensures quality but is also a little difficult for the developer to keep up with two major GNOME releases per year.

If my math is correct, there are about 400+ extensions present on the official website for all possible tweaks in the GNOME desktop. Hence, we list the 10 best GNOME Extensions that you can try out in Ubuntu Linux, Fedora Workstation, openSUSE or any Linux distribution with a GNOME desktop environment.

*Note: These GNOME extensions are tested with GNOME 42.*

### Top 10 GNOME Extensions in 2022 (for everyone)

The following list of extensions requires initial setup for GNOME extensions which you need to enable as per your Linux distribution. Refer [to this guide for the initial setup][2]. Moreover, to manage these extensions, you should install the [Extensions][3] app from Flathub.

#### 1. Arc Menu

The popular Arc Menu GNOME Extension gives you a traditional desktop menu from the modern GNOME desktop panel. It brings well-categorised menu items with installed applications in your system. Arc menu is one of the best GNOME Extensions, which is a must for every workflow.

A shortcut for the activities overview of GNOME is a nifty feature which is a plus. Moreover, Arc Menu also gives you a search bar which kicks off when you start typing for easy navigation. In addition, you get the logout, restart, lock and power off the menu at the bottom of the Arc Menu.

Here’s how it looks.

Try [Arc Menu][4] in GNOME Extension.

#### 2. Dash to Panel

The second extension in this list is the famous “Dash to Panel”, a fixed panel for the GNOME desktop that combines the default dock and top panel. It is essential for the GNOME desktop because it gives you much bigger flexibility in your workflow. With its extensive options such as position, colour, transparency, size, etc., you can make your panel look like anything.

One of the best GNOME extensions, and you can download it from here.

#### 3. Blur My Shell

If you want the ultimate blur effect in the entire GNOME desktop, you should install ‘Blur My Shell’. As its name says, it blurs the application overview screen, application view and the default top panels.

In addition, you can also control the blur intensity, and brightness with this extension. If you use the Dash to Dock extension, you can also blur the dock!

Here’s a side by side view of how it looks without blur and with blur effects.

#### 4. Floating Dock

If you want a different type of dock for your GNOME desktop, try Floating Dock. As its name suggests, it creates a dock that floats on your desktop. Moreover, you can easily use the drag handle to place it anywhere.

One of the exciting features is that this extension gives you the flexibility to change the pop out direction of the dock. For example, you can change the dock to expand to the right side via its context menu (which opens via a right-click on the dock handle).

* And display Firefox PIP (picture in picture) window in the overview!

These are neat features that give a cleaner look to the GNOME desktop.
