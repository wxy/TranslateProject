HydraPaper: A Wallpaper Manager for Linux with Multi-Monitor Support
======
Brief: HydraPaper is an impressive wallpaper manager for Linux users that also supports multi-monitor setups. Let us take a closer look.

By default, you get the ability to set wallpapers as per the desktop environment on your Linux distribution.

And, it is often limiting when trying to add a custom folder of wallpaper collection to the available selection. Moreover, when it comes to multi-monitor setup, you do not get the ability to choose separate wallpapers in your distro. So, you need to head out looking for a Graphical User Interface (GUI) program that lets you do that.

Fortunately, I stumbled upon an impressive option for Linux users i.e. **HydraPaper**.

### HydraPaper: Open-Source Wallpaper Manager with CLI Access

![hydrapaper wallpaper manager][1]

HydraPaper is a pretty helpful wallpaper manager built using Python 3 and GTK. It lets you select individual wallpapers for different monitors.

While it is primarily a GUI program, you can also perform the same tasks using the command line.

So, HydraPaper is a wallpaper manager for both GUI and CLI users.

It looks like a straightforward solution with a few neat features. Let me mention the key highlights below.

### Features of HydraPaper

HydraPaper lets you add your custom wallpaper collection, organize/select the folders you want, and pick wallpapers conveniently.

Some of the essential features include:

* Manager folder collection (toggle them in a single click as required).
* Pick a favorite wallpaper and add them to your favorite collection.
* Position the wallpaper as you prefer (zoom, fit with a black background/blur, center, and more)
* Ability to set a random wallpaper quickly from your collection, if that’s how you decide.
* Customize the wallpaper manager experience with dark mode, choose to save wallpaper separately, clear cache, etc.
* CLI support
* Single spanned wallpaper mode to apply across multi-monitors

It is pretty simple to use; you can pick and select wallpapers for different monitors or use the single spanned wallpaper mode from the options to apply one across multi-monitors.

You get to choose/add/delete folders, adjust the position, add favorites, and apply the wallpaper for dark mode.

### Installing HydraPaper in Linux

You can find HydraPaper as a [Flatpak package][6] on Flathub, fit for every Linux distribution. You can refer to our [Flatpak guide][7] if you’re new to setting up support for Flatpak.

You can also find it on AUR for Arch Linux distros, Fedora’s repository, and Debian (unstable).

I tested it on Manjaro Linux, and it worked just fine using the Flatpak package.

To explore more options, you can head to its [GitLab repository][8].
