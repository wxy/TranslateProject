10 Necessary Ubuntu Apps For Everyone [Part 3]
======
This article lists the top 10 necessary Ubuntu apps for your daily workflow.

We often forget that thousands of free and open-source applications can compete with other commercial counterparts in their category. Moreover, if you are a Windows user and thinking about getting rid of Windows completely, you should also be aware of such apps beforehand.

Hence, in this article series of “necessary Ubuntu apps”, we are featuring ten apps for much-needed awareness among Linux users.

This is part 3 of this Ubuntu Apps series. If you missed the earlier parts, you can read them here, Or navigate from the Menu above.
