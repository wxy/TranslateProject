How to Turn Off KDE Wallet?
======

KDE Wallet Manager is an app included by default with KDE Plasma desktop to store and manage passwords.

Whether it is about storing a website credential or an SSH key passphrase, you can do all that with KDE Wallet. It integrates well with the rest of the system without any hassle. You can configure it to do more (or integrate with more applications and window managers).

Considering it is a useful utility, why would you want to turn off the KDE wallet?

Sometimes KDE Wallet can pop up when you interact with an action that deals with a password/credentials. So, if that happens to you, our guide here can help you disable the wallet.

### Quickest Way to Disable KDE Wallet

Fortunately, you do not need to use the terminal or any sort of commands to disable it. You can do it right from the system settings using the graphical user interface (GUI).

Note that I tried this on **KDE Plasma 27.4**.

First, open the **System Settings** app from the dock or search bar.

Next, from the menu in the left sidebar, click on " **KDE Wallet** ".

📋

If you are running an older version of KDE Plasma, you need to install the KDE Wallet Manager (kwalletmanager) manually if you do not find the settings shown below.

You can do this via the software center of KDE (Discover) and then head back to the system settings to find the required option.

Here, you can access the wallet preferences, where the KDE wallet is enabled by default.

All you have to do is uncheck the " **Enable the KDE wallet subsystem** " option.

![][5]

Once done, hit " **Apply** " to have the changes in effect. You might be prompted to authenticate the action using the password.

Sure, not every KDE Plasma user utilizes the wallet. But, if it bothers you or conflicts with other applications, you can simply disable it.

Furthermore, you can explore some of the [best password managers][7] available for Linux:
